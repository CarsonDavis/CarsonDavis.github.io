## Introduction
Although many of the smaller bookbinding tools: bone folders, glue, needles, etc. are easy to find and purchase, the larger equipment is not. For example, a 75lb cast iron press is not something you can just buy on amazon. However, it is something you can make yourself.

## Nipping Press
If you want to buy a nipping press, there is some absolute junk available on amazon, you can get a $500-$1000 antique on ebay, or buy a $300-$2000 modern press.
<b>Commercial Options</b>
- [Olive and Oak Brunel Press](https://oliveandoak.com/portfolio/nipping-press/) - $2200
- [Smhedt Steel Press](https://www.schmedt.com/book-press-type-i-made-of-steel-pressing-area-320-x-440-cm/6011-001) $1500
- [Schmedt Double Screw Press](https://www.schmedt.com/bookbinder-s-wooden-double-screw-press-with-wooden-screws-screw-length-approx.-55-cm/60000000.B) with [Binding Boards](https://www.schmedt.com/pressing-board-made-of-beech-plywood-to-press-books-in-book-presses/6028-008) ~$350
<b>Building Your Own</b>
This is a ~100 year old design that I first discovered on in one of DAS Bookbinding's [excellent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfUCjqzfPv4). The basics are essentially two boards, some feet, and a clamp. You should be able to follow his video as a build guide.

I went a little overboard with person version of the press. First, I laminated two boards together to get a straighter end product with less chance of warping over time. And second, I added a floating caul made of stiffer wood to the top to distribute the pressure more evenly.

The press plates on mine are two laminated .75 in sheets, for a total thickness of 1.5 in and an area of 15.75x11.75. Since the clamp extends into the work surface, the actual usable pressing area is 15.75x9.5. The press can accommodate an 8.5in stack. Finally, the floating caul is made of oak and is 1.5x1.5.

It's large enough to press every one of my regular sized books, and about 3/4 of my coffee table books.

If you want to build a more traditional screw design, there are many great videos out there, such as [Uri Tuchman's press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8EzpBvPtE4) and [Darbin Orvar's press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vTo9hQS-T4). Darbin has [building plans](https://www.darbinorvar.com/misc/bookbinding-press-building-plan) available, and if I were to ever build a second press, I would probably go with a slight modification of Darbin's design. Here's an alternate version that uses a [dual post design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWintBboXFU). I would recommend avoiding the 4 post designs, as they are a pain to use.


## Finishing Press
<b>Commercial Options</b>
- [Olive and Oak](https://oliveandoak.com/portfolio/finishing-press/) - $350

Mine was built for me by my dad, and the primary jaws are made of ash. The jaws are 3.75in tall, and they extend 15in between the screws with a maximum opening of 2 inches. The bolts are not captive, so they can be easily replaced with longer ones to increase the opening size.

The [hand wheels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CC895SJJ) were an inexpensive $15 from amazon, but are oversized for the screws and needed an hour and a half in the shop to get a perfect fit. I've got a separate post on how that was done.
