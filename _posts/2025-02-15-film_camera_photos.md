### Overview
The Nikon FM was my first love. I picked it up at Southerlands in Huntsville for about $150, and it came with a wonderful pancake 50mm f/1.8 and a 55mm f/3.5 macro lens. It's got a max shutter speed of 1/1000, internal light metering, and viewfinder display of both aperture and shutter speed. It's considered "fully mechanical" as you do not need batteries to operate it (aside from the lightmeter).

Something to know about the pancake, it's minimum focusing distance is ~0.6 compared to the 0.45 of the 50mm f/1.4.

Some small details you might want to know...the unlike the FM2, FM has an adjustable aperture interface that lets you use the 1960s Nikon glass that uses an aperture prong. Additionally, although I have nothing but praise for my pancake Series E, you should know that there are at least variants. I have the later chrome ring version, and it is excellent. The plastic version is not as good. 

And...It's an absolute dream of a manual film camera to use. Everything about it is just so well thought out, and it just _works_. 

I now have well over 100 film cameras and more lenses than I want to think about, but it's honestly hard to beat the Nikon FM.

### Nikon FM2 Overview
If serial numbers of 5100016 - 5858632 were made between the years 1981 - 2005 and we assume an even distribution, what year and month was 5220802 made? This gives us a date of early 1985.

Arguably the best manual film SLR ever made, the Nikon FM2 is a brilliant and user-friendly tank. It takes everything good about the FM and perfectly refines it. It boasts a gorgeous honeycomb shutter that shoots 1/4000th that frankly makes me cringe any time I pick up some inferior 1/1000 or, god forbid, 1/500 camera. Fun fact, the famous photo of the Afgan Girl was taken with an FM2.

Honestly, I have shelves full of cool cameras to choose from, but in back of my mind anytime I look at my Leica or my Fujica or my Pentax or my Voigtlander, I'm always remembering the unrivaled versatility of a 50/1.4 lens, a 1/4000th shutter, and built in light meter and split prism.

I've shot with most of the 1970s-1990s mechanical 35mm SLRs, Canon, Olympus, Pentax, Exkacta, Cavalier, Kodak...you name it, and the FM2 is the best of the best. For all you sticklers out there, yes, if you widen the scope to include cameras with automatic features then the lust-worthy Nikon FM3a is the best.

I bought this camera right around the time that I stopped traveling for work and started shooting medium format, so compared to the FM, I have fewer photos to show for it. But I have a lot of love for this camera.

## Pentax K1000

### Overview 
The Pentax K1000 is commonly cited as being _the_ most popular student photography camera to ever exist. It was manufactured for over 20 years, from 1976 to 1977, and it is estimated that over 3 million were made. With it's rugged metal construction, simple controls, and built in light meter, it is easy to see the appeal. The camera was typically bundled with a 50/2 lens, but the K mount offers plenty of nicer glass to choose from, including a 50/1.4, an 85/1.7, and a 135/2.8.  

It is simple, it is reliable, and it is cheap. It takes perfectly good photos, and if you can pick one up for a budget price, you will not be disappointed.

However, if you are looking for the best 35mm SLR shooting experience, this is not it. In my estimation, it is inferior to my Nikons in almost every detail. The lens release button feels cheap and fragile, the max shutter speed it only 1/1000th, it lacks a shutter lock, there is no self timer, there is no aperture preview, there is no view finder display of aperture or shutter speed, the shutter speed dial is significantly less easy to adjust, and at least on my copy, the viewfinder is inferior. While my FMs have both a split prism and a microprism, the K1000 only has a microprism, and in general it feels dimmer and worse.

To it's credit, some people prefer the Pentax's needle light meter to the Nikon FM and FM2 LEDs. However, the Pentax light meter is always on, unlike the Nikon, which is turned off via the film rewind lever. You can trick the Pentax light meter into not using as much electricity by using a lens cap, but I still find that my Pentax batteries are always dead, while my Nikons last years. 

Supposedly, if your Pentaprism says AHCO, then it was made in Japan, not Hong Kong. However, mine has a sticker on the bottom that clearly says "ASSEMBLED IN HONG KONG". Actually, while trying to track down my 50/2 which I'm sure I own for this camera, I discovered that I actually own TWO Pentax K1000s. My second must be a newer model, as it only says Pentax on the prism.

## Pentax 67

These days, I think the best place to buy custom grips is (Pimp my Pentax)[https://www.instagram.com/pimp_my_pentax] on Instagram. He does dyed and stabilized wood for both left and right grips for around $200 total.

If I'im going somewhere specifically to take pictures, the pentax is at the pot of my list.

If I'm going somewhere to do something normal, and considering brining a camera for fun, the pentax is at the bottom of my list.


"The prism viewfinder on the pentax absolutely blows. the pentax just has a matte focusing screen, no split prosm screen. so to focus you need to be able to actually see that it is in perfec focus. and the prism viewfinder takes up an unacceptably small portion of my viewing antgle. i also have the chimney pinder, which is magnificent. easily the best viewfinder eperience n any camera tha i own. it greatly increases the camera volume and looks like shit too.

The 67 has a brighter viewfinder than the 6x7 too?

Minimum focusing distance. My nikon has 0.45, while the 105 is 1m. There exists a 90/2.8 that has 0.65m, which is a gain of 13.7 inches in focusing.


actual measurements of my negatives: pentax 4.44, fuji 2.77

This is probably the most iconic configuration of the camera, with the metered prism, the 105mm f/2.4 lens with the classic square hood, and the wooden grip. 

I don't honestly use it all that often like this, instead preferring the configuration below, with the chimney finder, the wonderful 45mm f/4.0, and a custom burl wood grip.

### Overview

The original Pentax 6x7 was released in 1969, then the MLU version was release in 1976 with improved with mirror lockup and and a better film advance, and finally the 67 was released in 1990, with improvements to metering and shutter timing. 

The actual size of the Pentax negative is about 56x70mm, which gives it a final area of 3920mm^2, or about 4.5x the size of a 35mm negative. 

10 images per roll? I have the plain focusing screen, which is relatively uncommon compared to the standard central microprism, considering that a screen replacement requires a technician and calibration.

This is by far my most expensive film system. For the body, two finders, two lenses, the original grip, and a custom grip, I've paid an uncomfortable $1333 for the body, lenses, and all the accessories since 2019. Even only considering my slimmed down configuration, it still totals $750. Looking back, the metered prism and the standard hand grip were a waste of money that I would encourage any potential buyer to avoid.

The shutter speed selection dial is esecially hard to use when the metered finder is installed, so I 3d printed a ribbed sleave that increases the grip.

If you want to buy one of these for yourself, note you should avoid the original 6x7 without mirror lock up, as it has less a reliable film advance

First shots, may 24, 2019 was when i sent them to kyle

My cu†om grip came from Bangkok, from the charmingly named, "Village no. 1". It is a beautiful piece of burl wood that fits the camera perfectly. I also have a custom 3d printed ribbed sleeve that makes the shutter speed dial easier to use.

Even with inexpensive medium quality scans, the resolution and detail in the Pentax is insane. Look at this zoomed in crop of the above photo, where you can see two tiny people in the distance. This particular shot was taken with the SCM Pentax 67 1:4 45mm lens, which is the sharpest and most optically advanced of the three 45mm lenses available for the Pentax 67.

If you want to take gorgeous landscape shots and worry about cropping later, it's hard to beat a Pentax 67 with a 45mm lens.

I have a lot of 1910s-1930s folders floating around the house, very few of which I have actually bothered to run film through. I forget now what inspired me to shoot this particular camera, but it produced some very interesting lo-fi images for my trouble. 

The camera is unbranded but the film viewing window cover bears the marks: "DRGM" and "BW". This leads us to identify it as a Balda 6x9 of unknown model, probably a Fixfocus, produced between 1933 and 1938. 

I came across a few nice resouces while researching it, including this page on the [Fixfocus specifically](https://www.collection-appareils.fr/x/html/camera-2451-Balda_Fixfocus.html), a lovely [interactive timeline of the Balda Camera](https://www.collection-appareils.fr/Timeline/frise.php?Marque=Balda) models, and an in depth review of a [newer iteration of my camera](https://schneidan.com/2015/11/09/all-about-the-balda-pontina-probably-camera/).

This was maybe the third film camera I ever shot with, and the first one that I did any work on. Not too complicated of a job, but when I bought it for $6 at an estate sale, the viewfinder was so dirty it could barely be used. Thankfully they are very easy to take apart for quick clean.

I actually cleaned of the lens of this one.

Vegas, HP5+ 400, october 2017ish.

When I bought this camera, it had a non-trivial amount of mold in the lens, which gave the photos a wonderful, soft look. I have since cleaned it out, but I almost wish I hadn't. 

## Nikon F2

<div class="grid-container grid-2x2">

    </div>
    <div class="caption"></div>
    <div class="caption"></div>
</div>

The Nikon F2 is the professional counterpart to the FM2. It's a larger and heavier camera in every dimension, and my verison wears a chonky metering prism. All of it's tiny details are more professional and refined

- self timer: it lets you set specific times, 2-10 seconds, and has a reset button if you decide not to use the timer
- aperture preview: replaces the FM2's plastic lever with fancy black and chrome button that matches the lens release
- mirror lockup: adds this feature as a twisting lever on the aperture preview button
- shutter lock: adds a second shutter lock as rotating dial around the shutter
- T mode: adds a T mode to the shutter speed dial, which holds down the shutter button after it is pressed and can be used in conjunction with bulb mode
- film rewind: adds knurling to the film rewind knob
- view finder HUD: instead of the shutter speed, lightmeter reading, and aperture being scattered across the viewfinder, the F2 consolidates all the information into the bottom right of the viewfinder. additionally, while the FM2's ss reading will be hard to see if you are pointing the camera at a dark backdrop, the F2 uses ambient light from the top and is consistently more viewable. as a side effect of this design, you can meter from the top of the camera without needing to look through the viewfinder
- ISO selection: goes slightly lower than the FM2, down to 6 instead of 12
- Viewfinder: interchangeable

There are a few downsides. Namely, the 1/2000 shutter instead of the 1/4000, and the added bulk and weight.

October 2017ish

I met a guy at a tradeshow who saw my camera and said, "I have a Nikon F2, but I never use it. I'll sell it to you for $200." I said, "I'll take it".

It came with some beautiful glass, including an 85mm 1.8. It's in stupidly mint condition and I keep it as a shelf queen, but I did put at least one roll through it.

cuase it is zone focus i carry it on my wrist. i ste tthe focus to like 15 ft and f/8 and just bring it to my eye and shooot. thejight meter is built into the top of the body, so as you walk around you can be tweaking the lm withough looking through the viewfinder. if this camera had a rangefinder, i wouldn't shoot with anything else. i adore this camera.

This is an astonishingly weird camera. Originally used for aerial photography, it was coopted as a press camera. The film is cycled by pulling a giant lever several inches out of the body, the lens is focused with a rotating knob, and it has delightfully goofy viewfinder attachments.

## Fujica GS645 Pro

A guy on ebay was asking $200 for this camera, but I offered him $150 and he accepted. He had test photos, but claimed it had a broken lightmeter, broken film advance, and a broken rangefinder, not to mention gross black stuff all over the logo. 

Bought for $171.88 after tax and shipping in Jan 2021. It was listed as having a broken light meter. 

This was during covid, and the perfect ones I was looking at were $700, so I figured even if I couldn't fix it, I could still use it as a zone focus camera, and find out if I wanted to spend real money.

When i got it, there was mold in the lens, the rangefinder seemed to partially work but slip sometimes. the lightmeter seemed to have an electrical contact issue, because it would actually occassionally work when you pressed _almost_ to taking the photo.

Apparently i cut a glass screen just to test the rangefinder, and confirmed that it worked perfectly.

one time the shutter button stuck and the camera took a bunch of photos as i cocked the film without me realizing
