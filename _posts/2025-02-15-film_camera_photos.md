## Introduction
So I've got a lot of film cameras, something like 120 at last count. I've been collecting and shooting them for around a decade, and I've managed to amass a couple neat cameras and a few decent photos. 

Sometime in the future I'll document each and every one of my film cameras and put them in their historical context, but this will not be that post. Here I'll just focus on the experience of shooting them, make some comparisons, maybe give some technical specs, and of course show some photos.

### Nikon FM: Overview
The Nikon FM was launched in 1977 as a fully mechanical 35mm SLR aimed at advanced amateurs. It was a lighter and more focused version of the professional F series cameras, offering reliability, simplicity, and durability at a more affordable price. In an age when many cameras were beginning to rely on batteries to operate, it promised a reliable fully mechanical operation that appealed to amateurs and professionals alike. 

### My Camera
This was my very first film camera, and I've put more rolls of film through it than anything else I own. I bought it at Southerlands Photo in Huntsville in mid‑2016 for about $150. It came bundled with the minimalist pancake 50mm f/1.8 and a 55mm f/3.5 macro lens. Over the next two years, while traveling extensively for work, I took this camera everywhere. This camera just works. It's small, reliable, take great glass, and I love it. 

### Tech Specs
- **Dates Manufactured:** 1977–1982  
- **Camera Type:** 35mm SLR 
- **Shutter Speeds:** 1s to 1/1000s (with Bulb mode available)  
- **Format:** 35mm  
- **Primary Lens:** 50mm f/1.8 Series E Chrome Ring (3291471, from 1981–1985)  
- **Serial Number:** FM 3091999  
- **Key Features:**  
  - 60/40 center weighted light metering.  
  - Viewfinder displays both the shutter speed and aperture.

### Final Thoughts
**Light Meter**: Not everyone loves the LED light meter, instead preferring the needle found in the early F models. 

**View Finder**: Almost perfect, with a split prism, a microprism, and both aperture and shutter speed displayed. I do slightly prefer the F2 viewfinder's placement of the shutter and aperture.

**Lens Compatibility**: Unlike the later FM2, the FM has a folding aperture interface lever that lets you mount the oldest non-ai lenses.

**Pancake Lenses**: The Series E pancake lenses were a cheaper and smaller alternative to the faster and more expensive Nikkor lenses. I own plenty of both varieties, and it is true that the Series E are cheaper and have more plastic. However, there are several versions of the Series E, including a kinda gross full plastic one and the one I have, which has a chrome ring and is actually quite good. Despite the naysayers, they have a bit of a cult following because of how small, portable, and cheap they are. If there is one huge downside, it is that the 50/1.8 E has a minimum focusing distance of 0.6m, compared to 0.45m for the 50/1.4 AIS.

**Shutter Lock**: All the nikons have a shutter lock that is integrated with the film rewind. Newcomers to the camera often struggle with this, but it is a very elegant solution that is easy to use once you start shooting. Essentially, you always rewind you film anyway after taking a shot. Anytime you go to shoot, you just unlock the film rewind, and then after the shot, you easily wind the film.

### Overview

The Nikon FM2 is arguably one of the best manual film SLRs ever made. Introduced in 1982 and produced through various revisions until 2001, this camera was originally marketed to advanced amateur and semi-professional photographers who demanded absolute reliability and rugged performance. Debuting with a body‐only price around $364 (chrome version) and later climbing to around $745, it was built for those who wanted a fully mechanical tool—operable without batteries except for its light meter. Praised for its fast vertical‐travel shutter (capable of 1/4000 sec) and precise, minimalist design, the FM2 quickly earned a reputation as a “tank” that could shoot in the most extreme conditions. Notably, its robustness and simplicity even won over legendary photojournalists; fun fact, the iconic “Afghan Girl” portrait was taken with an FM2.

### Personal Story

I purchased my Nikon FM2 right around the time I stopped traveling for work and shifted to medium format photography. Although that means I don’t have as many shots from my FM2 as from the FM, this is undeniably my desert island camera. With a fully mechanical design, a 50/1.4, and a top shutter speed of 1/4000s, it's very hard to argue with it's raw capabilities. It honestly makes it hard to convince myself to shoot with my some of my "cooler" cameras. It's everything that I love about my FM, but with slightly better technical specs. 

I really cannot stress how OP this camera is. I've got a Leica iiif, a Fujica 645, Pentax 67, Voigtlander Prominent, Yashica D, Rollei 35, Zeiss Ikonta, Exakta VX...just so many cool cameras, and it is just painful sometimes to shoot them. I'll go to shoot my gorgeous Voigtlander wide open at 1.5 only to be thwarted by the 1/500s shutter speed. Or I'll be out and about with my compact Fujica 645 and it's shockingly huge negatives only realize that I can't focus any closer than 1m and have to rethink my shot. Or I'll be focusing my Pentax 67 through it's massive and chimney viewfinder, only to take my eyes away every time I want to adjust the aperture or the shutter speed.

I have 120+ film cameras, and I desperately want to be that guy with the crazy camera you stop and chat with on the street. But god help me if the FM2 doesn't make it hard to shoot anything else.

### Specs

- **Dates Manufactured:** 1982-2001, my copy 87-89 (need to confirm after I finish the current roll of film)
- **Camera Type:** 35mm SLR  
- **Format:** 35mm  
- **Shutter Speeds:** 1s to 1/4000s
- **Light Meter:** 60/40 center weighted light metering, with upgraded sensor elements from the FM
- **Primary Lens:** Nikkor 50mm/1.4 AIS, 1981-2005, 5220802, ~1985  
- **Key Features:**  
  - My copy has the titanium honeycomb shutter, which isn't technically better than the later aluminum shutter, but looks awesome whenever you change the film.
  - Same great viewfinder as the FM, with display of both the selected shutter speed and aperture, and a split-prism + microprism focusing screen that makes critical focus a joy.
  - 
  - [Fantastic comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYqwdZe9dqM) between all of the FM and FM2 features.

## Pentax K1000

### Overview 
The Pentax K1000 is commonly cited as being _the_ most popular student photography camera to ever exist. It was manufactured for over 20 years, from 1976 to 1977, and it is estimated that over 3 million were made. With it's rugged metal construction, simple controls, and built in light meter, it is easy to see the appeal. The camera was typically bundled with a 50/2 lens, but the K mount offers plenty of nicer glass to choose from, including a 50/1.4, an 85/1.7, and a 135/2.8.  

It is simple, it is reliable, and it is cheap. It takes perfectly good photos, and if you can pick one up for a budget price, you will not be disappointed.

### Shooting Experience
However, if you are looking for the best 35mm SLR shooting experience, this is not it. In my estimation, it is inferior to my Nikons in almost every detail. The lens release button feels cheap and fragile, the max shutter speed it only 1/1000th, it lacks a shutter lock, there is no self timer, there is no aperture preview, there is no view finder display of aperture or shutter speed, the shutter speed dial is significantly less easy to adjust, and at least on my copy, the viewfinder is inferior. While my FMs have both a split prism and a microprism, the K1000 only has a microprism, and in general it feels dimmer and worse.

To it's credit, some people prefer the Pentax's needle light meter to the Nikon FM and FM2 LEDs. However, the Pentax light meter is always on, unlike the Nikon, which is turned off via the film rewind lever. You can trick the Pentax light meter into not using as much electricity by using a lens cap, but I still find that my Pentax batteries are always dead, while my Nikons last years. 

I've only shot one roll through my K1000, and that was enough for me. 

### Tech Specs
Serial Number: 7093688
Date: 1982-1983
Shutter Speeds: 1s - 1/1000
Lens: SMC Pentax-M 28mm f/3.5, 6873910
Weight: 606g

Supposedly, if your Pentaprism says AHCO as mine does, then it was made in Japan, not Hong Kong. However, mine has a sticker on the bottom that clearly says "ASSEMBLED IN HONG KONG". Actually, while trying to track down my 50/2 which I'm sure I own for this camera, I discovered that I actually own TWO Pentax K1000s. My second must be a newer model, as it only says Pentax on the prism.

## Yashica D

### Overview  
Produced by Yashica from 1958 to 1972, the Yashica‑D stood as the company’s top “knob wind” twin‐lens reflex (TLR) model. It originally sold for under \$50 in the early 1960s—a price point that translates to roughly \$400 today—making it an appealing option for serious amateurs and professionals seeking a robust, fully mechanical, medium format camera. Critics praised its durable build quality, reliable leaf shutter, and solid optics (notably the 80mm f/3.5 Yashikor or Yashinon lenses). Despite the fully manual operation (and the need for an external light meter), the Yashica‑D earned a lasting reputation for its bright viewfinder, ease of use, and timeless design.

### Personal Story
In January of 2017, I got it in my head that needed to start shooting medium format for the image quality, and a quick preusal of ebay revealed that TLRs were the sexiest cameras I had ever laid eyes on. They were like some steam punk fantasy that actually took great photos. Now Rollieflexes were way out of budget, but I still wanted the nicest quality I could get. Yashica sells a lot of models, the A, B, C, D, 124g, etc, with the D being the best fully mechanical version made. It comes with two lens options, the 3.5/3.5 Yashikor or the 2.8/3.5 Yashinon, which has an brighter viewing lens and improved taking optics. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently the Yashinon lenses were only made on the D between 1970 and 1972, making my model a bit of a rarity.

So anyway, in my quest to get acquire a high-performance, medium format workhorse, I located a wildly expensive $276 Yashica D, complete with a recent CLA, and a freaking a six‐month warranty, insane for a 45 year old camera. Interestingly, my particular example has “9‐28‐78” penciled inside, likely a service date.

### Shooting Experience  
Despite its boxy heft, the Yashica‑D is an absolute joy in practice—if you’re willing to slow down and embrace its quirks. The big, bright ground‐glass focusing screen makes pin‐sharp focus relatively easy to achieve. Its all‐mechanical controls, including the separate wheels for aperture and shutter speed on the front, are delightfully old‐fashioned. I actually enjoy the tactile feel: setting exposure feels intentional, and the camera’s “do‐not‐change‐shutter‐speed after cocking” rule encourages a measured, meditative approach.

I’m always amused by how the public reacts; the top‐down viewfinder is a conversation starter, and passersby love peering into it to see the world flipped. However, the leaf shutter’s maximum 1/500s limit can be challenging in bright light, and the minimum focusing distance of around 1 meter can feel restrictive—especially if you’re used to 35mm lenses that focus down to half a meter.  

Compared to something like the Pentax 6×7 system (with its faster 105mm f/2.4 lens and greater versatility), the Yashica‑D lags in sheer performance. Yet for me, there’s an undeniable charm to the TLR experience: the mechanical quiet, the waist‐level framing, and the slower pace of 12 shots per roll all contribute to a unique style of shooting. When given the choice between hauling a single Pentax kit or carrying the Yashica‑D (alongside my trusty Nikon 35mm), I often pick the latter—it just feels more fun and inviting.

All in all, the Yashica‑D remains a treasured part of my collection: a clunky box with modest specs but overflowing with vintage character. Writing this has reminded me just how enjoyable it is to use, and I’m already itching to take it out for another spin.

My main reason for seeking it out? I loved the classic TLR look, and I had been sold on the idea that stepping into medium format would unlock higher resolution than my 35mm setup. Truth be told, I still admire how it looks and the reactions it draws on the street; people are fascinated by the waist‐level finder and the reversed image on the large focusing screen.

### Specs  
- **Dates Manufactured:** 1958 – 1972  
- **My Approx. Production Date:** Likely post‐1970 (based on Yashinon viewing lens)  
- **Camera Type:** Twin‐Lens Reflex (TLR)  
- **Format:** 120 roll film (6×6 cm)  
- **Shutter Speeds:** 1s – 1/500s + Bulb (MXV shutter, 5 curved aperture blades)  
- **Lenses:**  
  - **Viewing Lens:** Yashinon 80mm f/2.8  
  - **Taking Lens:** Yashinon 80mm f/3.5  
- **Minimum Focus Distance:** ~1 meter (typical for TLR lenses)  
- **Serial Number (Mine):** D 7122389  
- **Unique Markings:** “9‐28‐78” written in pencil inside the camera body  

### Original
I'll be honest. I wanted a yashica because they look awesome. At the time, I was also super inexperienced and had been sold the idea that medium format was much higher resolution than 35mm. I bought one that had just been CLA'd and came wiht a crazy 6 month warranty for $276, thinking that it would be the gateway into the high quality world of medium format.

And I do really like my Yashica. it's a beautiful camera. And it is really fun to walk around taking pictures with it, looking cool, and meeting other photographers. The public in general is deeply fascinated by being able to look through the top of the camera and see the world in reverse and on the big bold screen.

However, it's a clunky box, and the tech specs leave quite a lot to be desired. An 80mm f/3.5 with a shutter speed range of 1s to 1/500s is not exactly going to get you through the a range of different lighting conditions. the minimum focusing distance of 1m is also a far cry from the 0.45m of my Nikon 50/1.4, although it is inline with other medium format lenses such as the pentax 105/2.4.

actually shooting with the camera is an interesting experience. the focusing window is excellent and large and bright, making it easy to nail the focus. and the antiquated wheels to adjust shutter speed and aperature with the leaf shutter lever give it a delightfully unusual and old timey feel. I'm honestly really fond of the quaint controls. they don't get in the way, and even though they are unusal by modern standards, they are easy to use and understand.

Writing this blurb is really making me remember what a fun little camera it is, and I'm excited to take it out again soon.

I will say. I've done some comparison shoots between it and the pentax 105/2.4, and there is really no comparison between thier capabilities. the pentax is simply just so much better in every way. but, if I had to choose between taking out the pentax by itself, or shooting with the yashica+nikon, I would choose the latter every time.

Bought in January 2017
Serial Number: D 7122389
Yashinon lenses (with f/2.8 viewing lenses) didn't arrive until 1970. These, and the last of the examples with Yashikor lenses, have MXV shutters with 5 curved aperture blades instead of 10.

Although the famous 105mm f/2.4 with the wooden pistol grip is the most iconic load out for this camera, I actually typically wear it with a chimney finder, the wonderful 45mm f/4.0, and a custom burl wood grip.

### Pentax 67 Overview
Produced between 1969 and 2009, the Pentax 6x7 is one of the most iconic medium format systems in existence. With a 6x7 cm frame size, it offers negatives almost 4.5 times larger than 35mm film, but in a familiar SLR form factor. Originally costing 2-3 times more than its 35mm counterparts, the 6x7 was aimed at professionals and serious enthusiasts who needed the high-resolution benefits of medium format without abandoning the familiar SLR handling. It was famous for its use in high fashion and editorial photography, and it maintains a cult following into the digital age. 

There are 4 versions to be aware of. The original 1969 6x7 was made for about a decade, until in 1976 the addition of mirror lockup attempted to address the prodigious mirror slap, along with improvements to the film advance system. In 1990, it was rebranded as the Pentax 67, with improvements to metering and shutter timing; and finally, the Pentax 67II arrived in 1999 with a major overhaul and more plasticy body.

If you are going to buy one, the 6x7 MLU and the 67 represent the best balance of price and quality. The original 6x7 and its less reliable film advance and should be avoided if possible, and the 67II is significantly more expensive.

### Personal Story

I personally first encountered the Pentax 67 at Central Camera in Chicago, and it took by breath away. After years of shooting a 35mm Nikon, seeing the Pentax was like realizing you could have a pet bear instead of a poodle. Although I'm usually very tentative about my purchases, I was on the verge of impulse buying it when the clerk demanded to know if I was there to buy or simply to ogle. Well, I went straight home and bought one on ebay instead, and since then I've dropped more than one and a half grand on the body, lenses, and various accessories. 

### Accessories
#### Handles
More than any other feature, people recognize the Pentax 67 by its ostentatious wooden handle. It gets tons of comments when walking around town, and it is touted as the perfect way to hold the boat anchor of a camera.

But functionally? The handle is a monumental failure of human design. The engineers who first proposed this handle should be committed to an institution to protect the public from any further inventions. I can't believe this isn't more talked about, because seriously, the thing is useless. 

It's in exactly the wrong place for you to hold while shooting, since your right hand needs to adjust the aperture and focus. And yes, I do own the gimmicky focusing extension ring, which is a giant pain in the ass, inventing a solution for a problem that shouldn't exist. If you own this camera, do yourself a favor and skip the factory grip, and instead buy a _right hand_ grip. Mine is burl wood from the charmingly named, "Village no. 1" in Bangkok, but these days I think the place to shop is (Pimp my Pentax)[https://www.instagram.com/pimp_my_pentax] on Instagram. 

#### Viewfinders
There are at least four viewfinders for this camera. A standard prism, a TTL prism, a waist level, and the chimney finder. I own a TTL and the chimney finder, and I _adore_ the chimney. It provides the largest, most magnified, most beautiful viewfinder of any camera I own. Sadly, my Pentax has the fully matte focusing screen instead of the standard split prism, and I would be lost without the high magnification of the chimney finder.

I would love to eventually pick up the waist level finder, but they are consistently $250 from Japan, and I haven't yet been able to stomach the expense.

If you are going to use the TTL finder, I have a 3d printed ribbed sleeve that I made for the shutter speed dial. It makes it much easier to adjust the shutter speed. 

### The Mythical 105mm f/2.4
People buy the Pentax 67 just to use this one single lens. It has an unbelievable cult status in the world of film photography, famous for it's insane depth of field, beautiful rendering, and "3d pop"...Seriously, people online will rave endlessly about this lens, positively frothing while they declare that the look is impossible to achieve on 35mm. They will say that medium format has more bokeh than 35mm, or that the 105mm will be more compressed than the 50mm, giving better background separation.

And it is a nice nice lens. But frankly, it is no different from a common 50mm f/1.2 on 35mm. There is absolutely nothing magical about it, and there is certainly no mystical 3d pop due to the lens itself. Essentially the 105mm f/2.4 on a 6x7 negative is roughly equivalent to a 50mm f1.2 on a 35mm negative, in terms of both framing and depth of field. But doesn't the 105 have more compression than the 50? Sadly no. Compression is not caused by the length of the lens, it is a function of the distance between the film plane and the subject. Since the 105 and the 50 are the same framing on their respective systems, the subject distance and therefore compression will be the same. 

Yeah I know, I'm a dirty, pentax-hating apostate for even suggesting it. But seriously, check out this [comparison video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbU-w0J_7MM) by Julien Jarry if you don't believe me. 

### Why Bother?
So if the famous lenses aren't really any better, then why bother with an expensive, heavy, massive camera that only gets 10 photos a roll? 

Well for starter, the negatives are gigantic. On top of having way more detail and less grain, I find them easier to develop and easier to scan. Only 10 photos per roll certainly seems like a downside, but as a slow and deliberate shooter, I rather appreciate not struggling to take 36 photos on a 35mm roll. 

And most importantly, you look like a badass when you shoot it.


### Shooting Experience

If I’m heading out *specifically* to photos, the Pentax 67 is at the top of my list. The massive negatives, the awesome lenses, the undeniable conversation factor...it's just so much fun.

However, if I’m out and about and want a camera “just in case,” the Pentax 67 stays at home. I could walk around with literally three Nikon FM2s hanging from my neck and they would take up less space than the Pentax. Carrying this thing slung over your shoulder for a day is enough to give you adult onset scoliosis.

It also simply has limitations that my more fully featured 35mm systems do not. Looking through my various pentax photographs, I notice quite a few where I had to compromise on the exposure. It's not the biggest deal in the world, but a max shutter speed of 1/1000 and a max aperture of f/2.4 mean that unless you are also lugging around tripods and ND filters, then you will be hard pressed to shoot wide open in the day, and you will struggle to keep shooting as the sun goes down. A tip I would give for low light shoot slightly wider than you need to, engage the mirror lock up, and let yourself shoot a stop slower than you think you can.

Finally, it really, *really* bears mentioning that the minimum focusing distance on almost all the lenses is miserable. Even if you get the 90/2.8 instead of the 105, the minimum focusing distance is still 0.65m, admitted a huge improvement over the 105's 1m but still a far cry from the 0.45m of my Nikon 50/1.4.

|  | Pentax              | Nikon              |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Wide     | 45/4 (**0.37m**)    | 24/2.8 (**0.30m**)  |
| Normal   | 105/2.4 (**1.0m**)    | 50/1.4 (**0.45m**) |
| Portrait | 165/2.8 (**1.6m**)  | 85/1.8 (**0.85m**) |
| Long     | 200/4 (**1.5m**)    | 105/2.8 (**0.314m**) |


In all, the Pentax 67 is a fun camera and I love it. But unless you are specifically wanting hi-res, huge negatives, like for epic landscapes or studio portraits, then you really might consider taking a smaller and more fully featured camera.

Even with inexpensive, medium quality scans, the resolution and detail in the Pentax is insane. Look at this zoomed in crop of the above photo, where you can see two tiny people in the distance. This particular shot was taken with the SCM Pentax 67 1:4 45mm lens, which is the sharpest and most optically advanced of the three 45mm lenses available for the Pentax 67.

If you want to take gorgeous landscape shots and worry about cropping later, it's hard to beat a Pentax 67 with a 45mm lens.

I have a lot of 1910s-1930s folders floating around the house, very few of which I have actually bothered to run film through. I forget now what inspired me to shoot this particular camera, but it produced some very interesting lo-fi images for my trouble. 

The camera is unbranded but the film viewing window cover bears the marks: "DRGM" and "BW". This leads us to identify it as a Balda 6x9 of unknown model, probably a Fixfocus, produced between 1933 and 1938. 

I came across a few nice resouces while researching it, including this page on the [Fixfocus specifically](https://www.collection-appareils.fr/x/html/camera-2451-Balda_Fixfocus.html), a lovely [interactive timeline of the Balda Camera](https://www.collection-appareils.fr/Timeline/frise.php?Marque=Balda) models, and an in depth review of a [newer iteration of my camera](https://schneidan.com/2015/11/09/all-about-the-balda-pontina-probably-camera/).

This was maybe the third film camera I ever shot with, and the first one that I did any work on. Not too complicated of a job, but when I bought it for $6 at an estate sale, the viewfinder was so dirty it could barely be used. Thankfully they are very easy to take apart for quick clean.

I actually cleaned of the lens of this one.

I came across this hidden in the back of an antique shop in Las Vegas for $175, and bought it without a second thought. It originally had haze in one of the internal elements which gave the photos a dreamy, low-contrast feel. I have since disassembled the lens and removed the mold, but I honestly wish I had just left it alone. 







When I bought this camera, it had a non-trivial amount of mold in the lens, which gave the photos a wonderful, soft look. I have since cleaned it out, but I almost wish I hadn't.

The Nikon F2 is the professional counterpart to the FM2. It's a larger and heavier camera in every dimension, and my verison wears a chonky metering prism. All of it's tiny details are more professional and refined

## Operation
It's similar to the FM2, but with a few key differences. The light meter can be viewed from the top at waist level. The 

- self timer: it lets you set specific times, 2-10 seconds, and has a reset button if you decide not to use the timer
- aperture preview: replaces the FM2's plastic lever with fancy black and chrome button that matches the lens release
- mirror lockup: adds this feature as a twisting lever on the aperture preview button
- shutter lock: adds a second shutter lock as rotating dial around the shutter
- T mode: adds a T mode to the shutter speed dial, which holds down the shutter button after it is pressed and can be used in conjunction with bulb mode
- film rewind: adds knurling to the film rewind knob
- view finder HUD: instead of the shutter speed, lightmeter reading, and aperture being scattered across the viewfinder, the F2 consolidates all the information into the bottom right of the viewfinder. additionally, while the FM2's ss reading will be hard to see if you are pointing the camera at a dark backdrop, the F2 uses ambient light from the top and is consistently more viewable. as a side effect of this design, you can meter from the top of the camera without needing to look through the viewfinder
- ISO selection: goes slightly lower than the FM2, down to 6 instead of 12
- Viewfinder: interchangeable

There are a few downsides. Namely, the 1/2000 shutter instead of the 1/4000, and the added bulk and weight.

God, what a gorgeous camera.

October 2017ish

I met a guy at a tradeshow who saw my camera and said, "I have a Nikon F2, but I never use it. I'll sell it to you for $200." I said, "I'll take it".

It came with some beautiful glass, including an 85mm 1.8. It's in stupidly mint condition and I keep it as a shelf queen, but I did put at least one roll through it.


actual prices:
- nikon f2 with 4 lenses for 150

## Buying a Beauty
I'm going to be honest with you...I bought this camera mainly because it looks freaking sick. 

I was in an antique store in Salt Lake City, when I caught a glimpse of it's gleaming curves, quirky viewfinder, and recto-circular lens hood. Closer inspection revealed that, far from just being gorgeous, it also sported a lovely 50mm f/1.5 lens. This would have been near the pinnacle of consumer lens technology when this camera was released in the 1950s, and it essentially meant that I could use this camera with a full artistic license that you rarely get in old bodies. 

I covertly checked the ebay prices, bargained the seller down to $400, and walked out with one of the prettiest and most capable old cameras in my collection. It is in absolutely mint condition and has basically every accessory you could want. Honestly, my copy has the look of something that sat in a display case for the past 75 years. If anyone ever did use this camera, they kept it wrapped in velvet the entire time. 

## Historical Context

The Voigtlander Prominent was produced between 1952 and 1958, until the release of the Prominent II. , It was designed to be a professional camera, and was priced as such. It was released in the same era as the Leica M3, the Contax, and the Nikon SP, and was in direct competition with them.

, putting it in direct competition with the Leica Ms, Contax, and Nikon SPsYou hear rangefinder with a Compur leaf shutter and expect some old folding camera with disentegrating leather, and instead you are met with the gleaming perfection of the Voigtlander Prominent.

This camera is so wierd. I found it in an antique store in 

It has this recto-circular lens hood which is 

I paid $400 for it which was a steal. 

## Usage
Honestly, it's terrible to use. Despite being volumetrically about the same size my Nikon FM2, with film loaded the Voigtlander weighs a whopping 1144g to the Nikon's 820g. The viewfinder is incredibly far to the right in a way that makes it feel like you face is always in conflict with your hand, and good lord is is surprisingly tiny. I'd say it is about the same brightness and size as my 1937 Leica IIIa, but where the Leica has a magnified, high-accuracy second rangefinder window, the Voigtlander has a small, integrated patch in the middle of the tiny viewing window.

For two years from 1952-1954, it made an interesting argument against the Leica iii and the Contax III, but with the release of the M3 in 

## Lenses
"An advanced 7-element 5-group Double Gauss design with an achromatized front group to enhance its performance, (especially at wide apertures), the Nokton was reputed to be the best 50mm f/1.5 lens of the immediate post-WWII era, surpassing the 50mm f/1.5 Leitz Summarit (which was based on a prewar Schneider design) and even edging out the renowned 50mm f/1.5 Zeiss Sonnar." - Jason Schneider


only 7 lenses in the whole range. I have the :
Lenses
- Voigtlander Dynaron 100mm f/4.5
- Voigtlander Skoparon 35mm f/3.5
- Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f/1.5, 3837817

Accessories
- Turnit 3 Viewfinder
- 310/49 lens hood

Filters
- G2 49s, 302/49, yellow filter
- UV 49s, 317/49
- Focar 1 47mm, 303/47, magnifing snap on lens

It also came with two additional magnifiers, but I don't know what lens they go with
- Focar A 1m, AR 40.5, 343/41
- Focar D 0.15m, AR 40.5, 348/41

Many of the accessories are stamped with "West Germany".

I love that they named the lenses like this. There is also the Ultron 50mm/2, and the Ultragon 24mm/5.8, which I don't have

This camera would have been competing with the nikon s, the lieca m, etc, and it lost that war. Eventually it was truly killed off by the nikon f and the adoption of slrs.

## Rollei 35 S

cuase it is zone focus i carry it on my wrist. i ste tthe focus to like 15 ft and f/8 and just bring it to my eye and shooot. thejight meter is built into the top of the body, so as you walk around you can be tweaking the lm withough looking through the viewfinder. if this camera had a rangefinder, i wouldn't shoot with anything else. i adore this camera.

This is an astonishingly weird camera. Originally used for aerial photography, it was coopted as a press camera. The film is cycled by pulling a giant lever several inches out of the body, the lens is focused with a rotating knob, and it has delightfully goofy viewfinder attachments.

## Fujica GS645 Pro

A guy on ebay was asking $200 for this camera, but I offered him $150 and he accepted. He had test photos, but claimed it had a broken lightmeter, broken film advance, and a broken rangefinder, not to mention gross black stuff all over the logo. 

Bought for $171.88 after tax and shipping in Jan 2021. It was listed as having a broken light meter. 

This was during covid, and the perfect ones I was looking at were $700, so I figured even if I couldn't fix it, I could still use it as a zone focus camera, and find out if I wanted to spend real money.

When i got it, there was mold in the lens, the rangefinder seemed to partially work but slip sometimes. the lightmeter seemed to have an electrical contact issue, because it would actually occassionally work when you pressed _almost_ to taking the photo.

Apparently i cut a glass screen just to test the rangefinder, and confirmed that it worked perfectly.

one time the shutter button stuck and the camera took a bunch of photos as i cocked the film without me realizing
