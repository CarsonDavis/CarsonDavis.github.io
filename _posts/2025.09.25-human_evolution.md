https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/shanidar-3-neanderthal-skeleton cool information

*note* Shanidar 5 has the same XFB, but no other mearusements recorded

However, what I actually used was 97.5 as the length, based on ChatGPT saying 195mm for the Maximum cranial length (glabella-opistocranion). Idk where it got this.

No information on the model page.
### more? 
[another cool neanderthal?](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-de-neandertal-ce29a98485a148bd928d5d43886fb577) should look into printing this one
[ANOTHER one](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-433rp7-94d6d0d89da44fae9201dbaf5250d6dc)

## Homo erectus
Length: 210mm (bone clones)

[with jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-georgicus-438a06818f954f8191da677303ac7987) - high detail, should print this one. might have model problems, not sure

[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-skull-d645e45ff307403e9d2073a6390fc353) - i think this is the one that i printed, but need to load it into the slicer and check.

[excellent](https://www.morphosource.org/media/000005791) this is from morphosource and it is the one that i requested the download of. it looks execellent, but need to get it into the softwar before i start requesting a lot of downloads. has some big ole cracks in it, big chunks missing. actually, this looks like a partial reconstruction of Sangiran 17

[great](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-pithecanthrope-de-javasangiran17-e2e8335158e942448f5ac879e8067602) this is a nice 75% cranium from Sangiran 17. definitely print this one.

the size of the model on this one compared to my two habilis skulls is insanley huge, at x:71.5. what's freaking crazy tho is the measurements from https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf give an XCB of fucking 161. at this point I simply don't care, i can't keep obsessing. i'll print it as is, at 50%, which is supposedly even smaller than the real skull

[skull cap](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-trinil-2-1979rp4-b83a24e9d57143b3a3257058f1b16eb9) interesting skull cap 


[awesome skull cap](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-pekinensis-skullcap-60ef90a4f4c742ee95786e6ee0d68b38) - - wierd fbx format. seems to be correctly scaled. printed at 50%. contains the brow ridge and the left side of the skull, but no face. big ole sutures. 

"A scan of a rare replica from the 1930s of the Zhoukoudian III Homo erectus pekinensis skull. Sadly the temporal and sphenoid bones on the right have been lost on the replica. The original fossils of the Zhoukoudian skull have been lost before WWII. Only a number of replicas now remain. This species of human lived during the Middle Pleistocene in northern China. Also known as Peking Man."

## Australopithicus sediba
wrote down 145 for the juvenile length
- XCB: 109
mine's width is about ~50mm, so a little too small
UW88-50

## Australopithicus africanus

### Taung Child
- Lenght: 131mm 
based on skulls unlimited [measurement](https://www.skullsunlimited.com/products/replica-taung-child-skull-3-pieces-bh-016)
[Listen to the radiolab story](https://www.radiolab.org/podcast/taung-child)

There's another one that i want to print, the [taung brain](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-taung25011rp11-1-0cc121b94edc4a409e4e3862254e729a). Super detailed and really fucking cool. should do it full sized. [face also](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-enfant-de-taung-1b53441de0d9454eaeae48ad2f37e0cf) [face and jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/primates-australopithecus-africanus-ac715114f43040769389a086a5635929)

### Miss Ples
[miss ples](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-miss-ples-93977b694cb74913ad5bec38ea2f9610) no sizing on this one, but decent model. this is the one that i printed

[paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2409098) says x:139, but when i use that value it is insanely too big. compared to my aethiopicus model, which has a cc of 410 and ples, which has a cc of 485
printed at x: 56


## Chimp
Link: [Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/pan-troglodytes-modern-25011rp4-1-1dd3785e1efb43be85bd89c680a69d0a)
Length: 195mm
this one was correctly scaled and i just resized the model
Pan troglodytes
Location: Africa.
Age: modern.
Dimensions: length, 195 mm; width, 130 mm; height, 105 mm.
Notes: RLA catalog no. 2501.1rp4-1 (cast). Male chimpanzee cranium. 

[juvenile](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/chimpanzee-skull-6ef86b9a368d4058b67f0c99a7880fb4) would really love to print this one or one like it, but this model is fucky and needs fixing

## Tchadensis
Link: [Sketchfab: Museo [UV] Historia Natural](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast-08a5eb1ecef444d3a5f13bf5a2818923)
Location: files/sahelanthropus-tchandensis/museo_historia_natural/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast/
Length: 183mm, based on the nature paper
the model was sized at 181.55, and so i printed a 50% scale of that

## Homo Florensis
- [should print](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-floresiensis-crane-et-mandibule-97b4975b1464401a824c6513234dd45a)
  - this is a scaled cranum with jaw. and it looks like it is even higher quality than the one that i printed, with deep sutures


## Homo heidelbergensis

### Steinheim skull

**Scaling**
- model page said y197 x129 z131, so I did x:64.5, which gave 1974.87%

**Decision**
- Status: üñ®Ô∏è To Print  
- Rationale: good broken detail, adds variation compared to more complete crania

- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-8b07fb8f41a74d589be05e7152a79612) ‚Äî great detail, includes jaw

**Decision**
- Status: ‚≠ê Wishlist  
- Rationale: detailed specimen, but not top priority ‚Äî eventually worth printing

**Scaling notes**
- Dimensions listed on site: 231 √ó 145 √ó 145 mm ‚Äî seemed huge  
- Printed instead at same size as my Neanderthal skulls (~100 mm long)
- PPS: Looking back later, it's possible these big sizes were correct. It seems a lot of them really are supposed to be in the 70s for XCB
- My measurment of the printed model is ~61 at the widest x

**Decision**
- Final print: ‚úÖ Printed (scaled to ~100 mm long)  
- Rationale: scaled for comparability rather than absolute dimensions  
- Open issues: might consider reprinting this the correct size...

Sadly, I didn't realize this at the time and so printed the other one.

**Scaling worksheet**
- Anchor metric: none used yet  
- Model scale: printed as-is  

**Decision**
- Final print: ‚úÖ Printed (from 2501.1rp74-1 model)   
- Scale: not sure how I scaled this one, as the model loaded tiny. the final print has a measured x: 71.38
- Open issues: revisit mislabeled higher-quality scan if reprinting

**Scaling worksheet**
- x (slicer): 63.02 mm (at 50% of model size)  
- Appears accurate at that scaling

**Decision**
- Final print: ‚úÖ Printed

## Paranthropus aethiopicus

[Geoffrey Marchal](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-b45efcb8b6fa459bb7f0e5726ac1d3e7)
ok, so this one didn't have a scale, but the two other ones did have a scale, so i copied their dimensions
[one](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-25011rp19-333ebef7b3c04af8b87c3ee7467b5470)
[two](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-f799f267330f4d2d994b154581074344)

- x: 75mm

note that the usual RLA that i print from didn't actually have the best quality model, instead Geoffrey did. I went to his page do see if he had any other good models, but there were only a couple. Need to recheck what they were.



## Keyanthropus platyops
costs $4 and might be open, maybe hold off on this one https://www.fab.com/listings/78029783-d33d-48f6-bcc5-db3d2fe5d08c
the other one on sketchfab is also open

[YES](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-40000-)
excellent, excellent, excellent
- it came already scaled, the final half x is 65.46. this is what i printed
- after printing, the front came off. need to recheck the model and see if i broke it or how to fix it
- ok, so this wasn't able to pprint correctly. i pulled it into onshape and created a file called "KNMWT 40000 - strong supports.stl" which is in documents/3d...

## Afarensis
[sizing](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-cranium-4562f063aba647d290abb5808d66f20a) ugly model, but has okish looking sizing (x: 56*2)

[good?](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826086/files)this looks suprisingly good? it seems to be a reconstruction but with nice texture in the model. should give this a second look at hink about printing

## Rudolfensis

[uliege](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-rudolfensis-efdb526f504842828d4e6133cf8b5f02) 
- KMN ER-1470
- sized from the model, x:61.86

[fragments](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-25011rp48-1-cranial-fragment-9805e109b6d14a9499485d0672710cbf) buncha fragments from this guy. well, 3. they make up the skull and would be neat to print


# Still Need to Print


## Aegyptopithecus zeuxis
- [link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/aegyptopithecus-zeuxis-crane-et-mandibule-c3364927d7f148e59bf0f65f5680d0b6) this is a nice skull with jaw, should consider it

## Gorllia
[skull with jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gorilla-sp-male-crane-et-mandibule-9a37fbf556bd4f52b0b98ec3b9e3ad5b) should look for somethinglike this to print

## Ardipithecus ramidus

[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-cranium-1b55fb758d164a60bab6a7d57f750b01)
[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-mandible-758bdb9201834f2eab61323ba0e786c3)
- this is the only one that is on sketchfab. decent detail, not scaled correctly

ok, so ardi is supposedly ~325 cc compared to habilis 1813 of ~500. also, is it supposedly similar to a chimp, but smaller than some, which can hit as high as 450. so anyway, my chimp skull is 65 so i made it 58 bc i felt like it. i want it to not be crazy bigger than paranthropus, which it is definitely going to dwarf. i don't fucking know man.. anyway, this is scaled at 160%


## Homo ergaster
Turkana child

[fragment](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-cranium-f461dbb45add4a0d944060b2d0a49f78)
this appears to be KNM ER 3883

[turkan child](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-skull-turkana-child-0ef67e21a9ab43d483134d8edd6535b4)

i have no fucking idea on either of these sizes. i looked up the brain volumes and they are 
- sanigran 17: 1004
- 1813: 510
- 3883: 804-845
- 15000: 880
(i printed all these at the same time). basically, 17 was scaled and seems to match the literature, and so was 1813. so i but the two ergaster as slightly smaller, at x:65. with turkana being 253% and 3883 at 2243%.

## Habilis
[real fossil](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-1813?o=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com) good features, but not high poly KNMER 1813. it also seems to be sized correctly. x:55 at 50%
africanfossils lists Dimensions:  x=168.00; y=112.00; z=114.00 mm
boneclones lists as 171,118,116
paper gives the XCB as 113mm, or 56.5
i'm printing at 56.5, or 271.71% scale

[twiggy, OH 24](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-twiggy-255074b073074c81a2d9764dc8ff21a2) decent. once you slice it it's not bad x:58 @50%
the paper gives the XCB as 120mm, or 60
i'm printing at x:60, or scale 51.37% (actually, i'm going to revisit this one later, still need to print this one)

need to look at bone clones to see how to paint this one https://boneclones.com/product/homo-habilis-skull-oh-24-BH-010



[great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-0c7485037f7b4511a470c32b05aa5912) also 1813, but missing two teeth?

[also great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/skull-replica-homo-habilis-f1bb5aedac164a5c82ae8ba775cc7e9d) this one has the missing teeth?? need to see what the deal is, maybe they were broken off that one museums cast or something...

https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf
this gives sizes for the fossils
sangiran 17: xcb: 

both of these seem on the small side...need to check

## Laetoli Footprints
[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/laetoli-footprints-65a1ec6d0af740fe97189bd761055a60)
Def need to print these. Made 3.66 million years ago in volcanic ash in tanzania, probably by australopithecus afarensis.

## Femurs

they are located in this folder, the gcode is. 5h 12m
- erectus
- [afarensis](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-25011rp17-femur-a9f94a4c008a435792b1edfad9b8783f)
- chimp
- [human](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/human-femur-a9c1f1a88b104c3fbfe975fa10b31b31)

all of them were sized by the model itself

## Naledi
[skull cap](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000084599?locale=en) this is neat, seems to be sized correctly - WITS - Lesedi Chamber - U.W. 102a-011
[skull with jawa](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000054666?locale=en) seems to be sized correctly too - LES1 - Homo naledi 'Neo' - Reconstruction of cranium

- i'm printing both of these at their actual listed sizes

## Hippo

[fuck yes](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hippopotamus-skull-27445833d318446abf254a96c24a9bcf) - dear god, i must print this


## Tiktaalik
[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tiktaalik-roseae-4bcd9214503e402d88014f6a37297154) awesome skan, but probably won't actually be printable
