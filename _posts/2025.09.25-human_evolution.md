## Homo neanderthalensis: La Ferrassie 1

## Homo neadnerthalensis: Shanidar 1
[Sketchfab: Person](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/neanderthal-skull-9b3c92418e564edc8cc84dda42e6c761)

[Length source](https://www.academia.edu/figures/7188879/table-2-selected-measurements-from-the-shanidar-and-crania)
Location: files/neandertal/shanindar-reconstruction/neanderthal_skull.stl
- GOL: 207
- XCB: 154
- XFB: 128

*note* Shanidar 5 has the same XFB, but no other mearusements recorded

However, what I actually used was 97.5 as the length, based on ChatGPT saying 195mm for the Maximum cranial length (glabella-opistocranion). Idk where it got this.

No information on the model page.

## Homo erectus
Length: 210mm (bone clones)

## Australopithicus sediba
wrote down 145 for the juvenile length
- XCB: 109
mine's width is about ~50mm, so a little too small

## Taung Child
- Lenght: 131mm 
based on skulls unlimited [measurement](https://www.skullsunlimited.com/products/replica-taung-child-skull-3-pieces-bh-016)

There's another one that i want to print, the [taung brain](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-taung25011rp11-1-0cc121b94edc4a409e4e3862254e729a). Super detailed and really fucking cool. should do it full sized. [face also](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-enfant-de-taung-1b53441de0d9454eaeae48ad2f37e0cf) [face and jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/primates-australopithecus-africanus-ac715114f43040769389a086a5635929)

## Panthropus bosie
[Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology: Paranthropus boisei (2501.1rp74-1) - cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-boisei-25011rp74-1-cranium-9b0fe239afbc49e9a2bec1bb05dbd55c) 
  - this is the one that i printed


[Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology: Paranthropus robustus (2501.1rp10)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-robustus-25011rp10-0b541e124a8e41c285020329ef000283)
  - really nice type specimin
  - excellent ridge
  - x: 65.17
  - NOT ROBUSTUS??
  - sadly, this scan also exists, AND it is higher quality, but it is mislabeled so i didn't print it

[wow](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-732?o=1)
definitely need to print this one. it's a half face fragement and looks awesome.

[jaw](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-3230?o=1) bunch of nice parts here like jaws too

## Chimp

Length: 195mm
this one was scaled 
Pan troglodytes
Location: Africa.
Age: modern.
Material: epoxy resin cast.
Dimensions: length, 195 mm; width, 130 mm; height, 105 mm.
Notes: RLA catalog no. 2501.1rp4-1 (cast). Male chimpanzee cranium. Cast manufacturer unknown. From the teaching collection of the Research Laboratories of Archaeology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Model by Jordyn Gray.

## Tchadensis
Link: [Sketchfab: Museo [UV] Historia Natural](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast-08a5eb1ecef444d3a5f13bf5a2818923)
Location: files/sahelanthropus-tchandensis/museo_historia_natural/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast/
Length: 183mm, based on the nature paper
my model is sized at 181.55, and i used this as my actual number


## Heidelbergensis

There are at least two more good ones to print:
- [Steinheim skull](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-steinheim-skull1979rp45-e4220013e3d3454d9b7492d47116fe86)
  - really nicely broken
- [Atapuerca 5](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-8b07fb8f41a74d589be05e7152a79612)
  - great detail, with jaw
- [Broken Hill](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-sapiens-25011rp35-cranium-96ce6fa86a01479d907f7032e3e8f9b1)
  - actually printed this one
  - even though [another broken hill](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-broken-hill-1979rp9-91c4a28787c04df39540a290528794fa) had more detail, but was reconstructed.


the numbers on the site for dimensions were 231x145x145, but this seemed huge to me, so i printed it the same as my roughly the same neanderthal skulls, at 100mm long

## Panthropus Robustus
[Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology: Paranthropus robustus (2501.1rp23)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-robustus-25011rp23-63b6f246e55e411492bb8a4615f2bee0)
  - maybe the most interesting specimen
  - nice old look to it, missing lots of teeth, smashed skull, slight ridge
  - x: 71.63 (i scaled this, the paper said bizygomatic breadth is 143)


[Sketchfab: LTUArchaeology: DNH 7 Paranthropus robustus female](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dnh-7-paranthropus-robustus-female-c581173550444e5e95d2dc9df611c450)
  - _tons_ of gorgeous cracks in the top of the skull
  - female, no ridge
  - x: 63.02 (this was 50% of the model size, and it seems pretty accurate)


all of these are about 84-91mm when in half


# Remaining to Print

## Ardipithecus ramidus

[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-cranium-1b55fb758d164a60bab6a7d57f750b01)
[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-mandible-758bdb9201834f2eab61323ba0e786c3)
- this is the only one that is on sketchfab. decent detail, not scaled correctly

## Paranthropus aethiopicus

[Geoffrey Marchal](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-b45efcb8b6fa459bb7f0e5726ac1d3e7)
ok, so this one didn't have a scale, but the two other ones did have a scale, so i copied their dimensions
[one](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-25011rp19-333ebef7b3c04af8b87c3ee7467b5470)
[two](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-f799f267330f4d2d994b154581074344)

- x: 75mm

known as the black skull?

## Keyanthropus platyops
costs $4 and might be open, maybe hold off on this one https://www.fab.com/listings/78029783-d33d-48f6-bcc5-db3d2fe5d08c
the other one on sketchfab is also open

[YES](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-40000-)
excellent, excellent, excellent
- it came already scaled, the final half x is 65.46

## Afarensis
[sizing](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-cranium-4562f063aba647d290abb5808d66f20a) ugly model, but has okish looking sizing (x: 56*2)
[miss ples](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-miss-ples-93977b694cb74913ad5bec38ea2f9610) no sizing on this one, but decent model

[paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2409098) says x:139, but when i use that value it is insanely too big. compared to my aethiopicus model, which has a cc of 410 and ples, which has a cc of 485
printed at x: 56


## Notes 
I've printed the following skulls

 Homo neanderthalensis: La Ferrassie 1
 Homo neadnerthalensis: Shanidar 1
 Homo erectus
 Australopithicus sediba
 Taung Child
 Panthropus boisei
 Chimp
 Tchadensis

 What 3 skulls should i print next to really highlight human evolution. I think one of them skould probably be a human skull, and for the other two, i'd like to focus on specific an interesting fossils if possible, not just type specimin reconstructions
