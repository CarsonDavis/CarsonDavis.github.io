## The Magic of Shift
Think about your keyboard. How do you type a capital F? Does it have a dedicated key? What about the exclamation mark?

We rarely consider it, but when you hold the shift key, the entire keyboard transforms. Lowercase letters are replaced with uppercase letters, the slash becomes a question mark, the number one becomes an exclamation mark...

You hold shift, and you get access to a secret hidden layer. It's like having a whole other keyboard hidden behind the first one.

Look at the green keys in this diagram; every one of them changes when you press shift. This is the magic of layers. 

Imagine if there was no shift key at all, if there was no such thing as multiple layers.

## QWERTY's Legacy
In fact, there actually existed a couple of [notable typewriters](https://www.antiquetypewriters.com/typewriter/duplex-2-typewriter/) that had a completely separate key for both the uppercase and the lowercase letters. 

In the 1800s when typewriters were invented, the shift layer wasn't some software abstraction, but a problem of physical implementation. The carriage actually lifted when you pressed the shift key, in order to cause a different part of the hammer to strike the paper. Depending on the typewriter, this took genuine physical effort. Not only was using the shift layer harder than pressing regular keys, but to add a third layer you would need to lift the carriage twice as high, with twice the difficulty and travel. 

Between these physical considerations and the tendency of the typewriter market to adopt the standard everyone already used, the shift layer ended up being the only additional layer added.

## The Case for More Layers
As you may have guessed by the post title, I'd like to make the argument that in the days of software, when everyone can program their own keyboards however they want, we should have more than just two layers.

In fact, this has already been happening. As laptops have strained to make keyboards ever smaller, we have begun to see a new kind of layering: the function key. On many laptops you can hold the function key and get access to brightness, sleep mode, media controls, and more.

But I want to take an even more radical approach.

Remember the home row from typing class? The keys asdf jkl; are where you rest your fingers. These are the 8 keys that are the easiest to press, and I have colored them and the space bar (for you thumbs) in green. 

The blue keys are an easy movement from the home row keys, while orange keys are a little bit of a stretch, and red keys are downright difficult.

If we wanted to make typing as easy as possible, we could make a start by getting rid of the red keys altogether, and somehow moving their contents onto layers.

Maybe something a little like this. We'll get to my layout in a little bit, but this is pretty similar to what I actually use. Strikingly, you'll notice that I didn't just remove all the red keys...I also put six new keys where the space bar used to be. 

## Thumbs are Awesome
Here's the thing. Like pretty much everyone else on earth, I type all the time on my phone, using only my two thumbs. Thumbs are awesome -- they have the control and finesse to easily type on a tiny phone keyboard, and yet every physical keyboard I've ever used uses both thumbs for just one key: the space bar. 

That's 0.5 keys per thumb. Meanwhile, count how many keys your pinky is supposed to click. Depending on what you include, the left pinky gets ~11 keys and the right pinky gets ~16 keys. 

In what insane world do we give our weakest, most useless fingers ~27 keys, and give our amazing thumbs 1 key to share between them?? Absolute madness.

So anyway, those 6 new keys my thumbs, and they generally do tasks the pinkies would do on a traditional keyboard. The left hand thumb has ESC, Backspace, and shift, while the right hand thumb has enter, space, and tab. Let me tell you, just being able to casually click your thumb down to press shift or backspace is an absolute game changer.

But why 6 keys specifically? Well, there are actually keyboards that have as many as 12 keys in a big cluster dedicated to the thumbs, but I've never found that necessary. With 3 per thumb, you have one key in the middle that your thumb sits on naturally, then you have one for when you reach your thumb out and one for when you pull your thumb in.

## Numpad

Ask anyone who does serious data entry and they will tell you the numpad is awesome. It's so fast to reach you hand over to the numpad and slam out a long series of numbers. But of course, you would never want to do that in the middle of typing a sentence, because it would immediately break the flow.

But remember how easy it is to type a capital letter? You just hold shift and you get access to this hidden layer full of capitals, and you don't have to move your hand anywhere at all. 

So what if we had an <i>extra</i> shift key, that when you held it, turned the home row into a numpad?

[insert image of numpad layer]

Now typing numbers is as easy as hitting shift. 

## Symbols
But what about the symbols?? How will you type exclamation marks parentheses if we get rid of the number row? 

The answer is another layer for symbols. For this, we move the symbols down to the home row, and rotate the less used symbols slightly up to the blue keys.













## below this is trash

So just to be clear, the keyboard you've been using your whole life has two layers: the QWERTY layer, and the shift layer. Is two layers the right number? 

Clearly it solves a lot of problems, but it's still not perfect. Think about what it's like to have to reach your hand over to the arrow keys or to the numpad. Even stretching up to the number row can be a pain.

Ideally, you want to move your fingers as little as possible. Think about the home row

![img](keyboard_layout-reach.png)

In the image above, I've colored in green where your 10 fingers naturally rest: the home row and the space bar. These keys are the easiest to press. Then in blue are keys that are a small finger movement away from a home row key. Orange shows keys that are an uncomfortable reach. Finally red shows keys where you have to significantly move your hand and fingers to reach the keys.

This is the primary layout of my keyboard. There's a lot going on here, but for now just focus on how many keys there are...42. Besides being an obviously perfect number, that is less than half the keys of a traditional full-size, 108 key keyboard.


Here you can see it next to a traditional keyboard.


## Home Row Mods
What about control, alt, windows, and shift? These are called modifier keys, and in most use-cases there is something special about them. You don't click the control key or the shift key or the alt key. You hold it.

Alternately, you don't hold the A or the S or the D or the F keys. You click them.

So a very common keyboard layout trick is to double up on the home row keys. When you click them, they are ASDF, but when you hold them, they are control, shift, alt, and windows. You do this on both hands, matching on the fingers. So the index finger is control, the ring finger shift, etc. 

Is this somehow better than leaving them where they were? Yea, it's fucking awesome. Press CTRL+SHIFT+V on your normal keyboard, to do a paste without formatting. The finger gymnastics are ridiculous. You have to move you hand completely off the home row, twisting your pinky and ring finger and stretching out your index to hit the v.

Now try pressing J, L, and V at the same time. Without even having to move your hands, you just press down on you index and ring finger with your right hand, and then click the V with your left hand. 

## home row mods

- qwerty shortcuts suck, stretch pinky, emacs pinky medical condition
- avoid this by making the home row, when held, give us ctrl, alt, shift, windows/cmd

## Keyboard firmware
QMK vs ZMK vs moonlander interface
