## The Magic of Shift
Think about your keyboard. How do you type the exclamation mark? Does it have a dedicated key?

We rarely think of it, but when you hold the shift key, the entire keyboard transforms. Lowercase letters are replaced with uppercase letters, the slash becomes a question mark, the number one becomes an exclamation mark...you hold shift, and you get access to a secret hidden layer.

<!-- It's like having a second keyboard hidden behind the first one. -->

Every green key has changed. This is the magic of the shift key. 

Imagine if there was no shift key at all. You'd need about a million keys to get anything done.

This would be terrible; you'd have to move your hands all over the place, losing your position and breaking the flow of typing.

## QWERTY's Legacy
In fact, there actually existed couple of [notable typewriters](https://www.antiquetypewriters.com/typewriter/duplex-2-typewriter/) that had a completely separate key for both the uppercase and the lowercase letters. 

In the 1800s when typewriters were invented, the physical mechanics of the keyboard placed a limit on the number of layers you could build into a keyboard, and the quick adoption of the QWERTY layout meant that the shift key was the only layer that was ever added.


## The Care for More Layers
As you may have guessed by the post title, I'd like to make the argument that in the days of software, when we can program our keyboards however we want, we should have more than just two layers.

In fact, this has already been happening. As laptops have strained to make keyboards ever smaller, we have begun to see a new kind of layering: the function key. On many laptops you can hold the function key and get access to brightness, sleep mode, media controls, and more.

But I want to take an even more radical approach.

Remember the home row from typing class (asdf jkl;) where you rest your fingers. These are the 8 keys that are the easiest to press, and I have colored them and the space bar in green. 

The blue keys are an easy movement from the home row keys, while orange keys are a little bit of a stretch, and red keys are downright difficult.

If we wanted to make typing as easy as possible, we would have all necessary keys just within the green and blue keys.

## My Keyboard

Here's my keyboard. As you can see, I've gotten rid of a LOT of keys. 


So just to be clear, the keyboard you've been using your whole life has two layers: the QWERTY layer, and the shift layer. Is two layers the right number? 

Clearly it solves a lot of problems, but it's still not perfect. Think about what it's like to have to reach your hand over to the arrow keys or to the numpad. Even stretching up to the number row can be a pain.

Ideally, you want to move your fingers as little as possible. Think about the home row



In the image above, I've colored in green where your 10 fingers naturally rest: the home row and the space bar. These keys are the easiest to press. Then in blue are keys that are a small finger movement away from a home row key. Orange shows keys that are an uncomfortable reach. Finally red shows keys where you have to significantly move your hand and fingers to reach the keys. 




- without shift, we'd need a 200-ish key keyboard, hands have to move all over the place. you're basically playing an organ to use a computer
- regular 100% qwerty keyboard, hands still have to move everywhere
- why stop at one shift? nicer to have 3-ish keys per finger, hands don't have to move
- layers for symbols, numpad, arrows
- you actually already are used to this. shift, ctrl, alt, windows key are all layers

## the thumb is powerful

- phone keyboards are fine, when you give the thumb keys, put new layers on the thumb.
- programmable keyboard: keys can pull double duty even on one layer: tap, hold, combos, etc

## home row mods

- qwerty shortcuts suck, stretch pinky, emacs pinky medical condition
- avoid this by making the home row, when held, give us ctrl, alt, shift, windows/cmd

## Keyboard firmware
QMK vs ZMK vs moonlander interface

## Our layout

I highly, highly recommend starting with this layout or a small modification of it.
Everything has been well thought out and 

### symbols layer

### numpad layer

### arrows layer
