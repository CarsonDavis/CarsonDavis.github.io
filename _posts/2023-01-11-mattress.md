At some point in your life it stops being acceptable to sleep on a twin mattress on the floor. If you are me and you just turned 31 and your mom keeps asking you why you aren't married yet and WHAT DO YOU MEAN you don't even have a girlfriend and you find yourself looking guiltily over at your twin mattress and thinking that obviously a KING mattress will give your mom those grankids she keeps asking for...then clearly the first thing you did was go to the notorious den of incels and weirdos to get advice. Reddit. 

Because of course reddit has an entire community dedicated to mattresses. And of course nice mattresses cost thousands of dollars. Do you know how many dinner dates I could have at Arby's with thousands of dollars!? I could probably get my mom those gran...anyway, it turns mattresses are expensive.

I spent days reading mattress reviews. Sleep number, tempur-pedic, purple, plank...my budget went from $500 to $1000 to $2000 and then I realized that rent and food were unimportant and I was checking the limit on my credit card and googling 'how to get a loan for an $8000 mattress', when I found it. The dark underbelly of the reddit mattress community. The DIYers.

the_levathan711 [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/otdqms/diy_mattresses_an_introductory_guide/) that defined the community. 


100% stomach sleeper, building my first DIY, 5'9", 175lb.

I prefer firm (I often sleep on the floor with blankets underneath when traveling if the bed is too soft). I fold my arms under my head and although my back feels great on extra firm surfaces, I do sometimes wake up to pain in my arms/shoulders if sleeping on the floor.

I started with the guide from u/the_leviathan711 and went from there. My theory was that this build would have a firm base with a thin 2in topper of soft memory foam, to hopefully give lots of support but also a small buffer zone to remove pressure points.


I like the idea of latex, but I was worried about the motion transfer. So I was hoping I could get the best of both worlds with a little memory foam on top.

A mattress fundamentally needs two things, a softer comfort layer to reduce pressure points on you arms/head/etc, and a firmer support layer which keeps your body from sagging into the mattress. The position you sleep in, side/stomach/back, will determine just how firm or soft the overall mattress should be.

_I stole this diagram from snoozzzmattress.com_

If you look at this diagram, you can see that depending on the sleeping position your butt/hips/arms/shoulders will need to sink into the mattress to keep your spine aligned. If you sleep on your side, then there will be a large protrusion at your hips and shoulders, so you will need a softer mattress that can give in these areas to allow spinal alignment. But if you are a stomach sleeper, you will need a firmer mattress, so your heavier hips don't sink too far and mis-align your spine.
