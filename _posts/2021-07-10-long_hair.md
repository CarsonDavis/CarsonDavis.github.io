I hated haircuts, but it was the second to last day of school and my dad told me I could have any hair cut I wanted. 4th grade me thought indians were _awesome_, so obviously I got a mohawk. 

Months passed, and I still hated hair cuts, and with this precedent set, I proceeded to go the next four year without seeing the inside of a barber shop. It started off as a joke, but then long hair became kinda my thing, and then I found out you could donate it to kids with cancer, and so obviously I couldn't cut it with that knowledge in hand.

Although I typically kept it in a pony tail, when I did eventually let it down it was long, real long. At it's longest, when measured from the scalp, it was just short of 2.5 feet. Long enough that when wet I could sit on parts of it.

Interestingly, sometime in high school, 2008 or 9, I started wearing a tight buzz cut. You would think this would be an easy hair cut to maintain, but I've actually found that the shorter you go, the more often you have to cut it. At this length, it needs to be cut every single week or it starts to look bad.

I went through a few different styles in the intervening years, and I unfortunately have not found many great photos, so we will need to skip forward a decade to when I, like many men, got my covid hair cut.

Thankfully as my hair got longer I cut off the beard.

I think I've had this particular hair cut at 5 distinct times in my life, and it's probably my favorite lenght. On a good hair day it falls down in loose curls, and it's just long enough to easily keep out of my face. 

Unfortunately it only stays at this perfect length for a couple months. An shorter and it's always in your face, and any longer and the weight starts to pull the curls out.

I couldn't make a whole post about hair and not include this photo
