## Overview
Wood carving has to be one of the coolest hobbies I’ve ever picked up. You can get started with high-quality tools and materials for around $50, and you’ll be carving impressive projects on your first day. Early projects can be completed in about 1 to 1.5 hours, and there’s something magical about transforming a simple block of wood into a little character.

## Getting Started
I learned everything I know from watching YouTube videos, and [Doug Linker's](https://www.youtube.com/@dougLinker) channel, in particular, has been the single best resource in my wood carving journey. Doug creates excellent caricatures in easy-to-follow videos. He always makes several versions of a project before recording the final one for public viewing, so by the time he shares it, his advice is clear, concise, and full of helpful tips. Doug excels at using minimal cuts to convey the shape and emotion of a piece, and I cannot recommend his videos enough. Here are a few I followed along with:

- [Safety and Techniques plus Carving a Moravian Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E65f40Fm1k): A great intro to wood carving techniques and safety, along with a simple project to get you started.
- [Guide to Gouges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEcOne4XbXA): You’ll notice his two favorite gouges are almost identical to the ones in the Flexcut Palm and Knife Set KN600.
- [Wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlIr95-ZlCc): Learn to make awesome little wizard ornaments with just a few simple cuts.
- [Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxh1ezJEHzQ): A delightfully cute bear carving.
- [Owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXY3wuRn5yo): A simple owl carving full of character.

Doug has many more excellent videos. Here are some that I plan to try in the future:
- [Gnome Door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArVAO7CB9fI)
- [Hillbilly Gnome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4AXNQMxeIM&list=PLLMAepy0T3HzM8sSwb2TDMNa_O1iK1NZ8&index=4)
- [Mushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAMBDcblyBQ): I’m really looking forward to trying the round door one at 32:58.
- [Cardinal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLbghQByfOw)
- [Santa Ornament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpfL2DITRUs): I love the fun details in this one.

## Essential Tools
As I mentioned, you can start wood carving for around $50. While I now own an embarrassingly large collection of carving tools, you can easily complete all the projects on this page with just the following items:

- [Cut Resistant Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HPU3GFS) - $15: A sharp wood carving knife can easily cut through your finger and into the bone. Always wear a cut-resistant glove on the hand holding the wood. There are plenty of options on Amazon, but these are the ones I use and trust.
- [BeaverCraft GW10 Basswood Carving Blocks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D9ST5PF) - $20: Basswood is soft, easy to carve, and perfect for both beginners and experts. This pack of 10 blocks is a great size for small projects and much better than using random wood you might have lying around. Well worth the money.
- [Flexcut Cutting Knife KN12](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ZRZQ1G) - $20: Flexcut makes professional-grade knives, and if you only buy one, this should be it. It’s my most-used, most-versatile knife from Flexcut and will get you through many beginner and intermediate projects.

### Other Tools
Here are a few other notable tools that I'd like to talk about.
- [Flexcut Palm and Knife Set KN600](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EG033Y) - $70: This is the best and most complete beginner wood carving set available for under $100. It includes two palm gouges, a standard knife, and a detail knife, all made from 1095 carbon steel, which takes a fine edge and is easy to sharpen. The handles are comfortable, and the blades are thin but sturdy, making carving effortless. You’ll be able to carve almost anything with this set. If you want to buy the pieces individually, the set includes the KN12 Cutting Knife, KN13 Detail Knife, FR306 #6 x 5/16" Sweep, and FR307 70° x 1/4" V-Tool.
- [Flexcut Chip Carving Set KN115](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057P4ARM) - $48: A specialized 3-piece set for chip carving, which involves creating intricate designs by removing small chips of wood. While high-quality, it’s not essential for beginners.
- [Morakniv Wood Carving 120 Knife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JJ8HRBH) - $30: This is an excellent roughing knife for larger projects. It’s thicker and longer than the Flexcut knives, making it great for removing large amounts of wood quickly. I own the laminated variant, which holds an amazing edge due to its hardened core (60-61 instead of the CS's 58-59).
- Handmade Knives: There are many talented makers of beautiful, high-quality carving knives. I own two by Mike Shipley from Ozark County Carving Tools, both purchased for less than $30 each. I have the [1" Detail Knife](https://mountainwoodcarvers.com/products/copy-of-occt-original-walnut-whittler-1-1-4-flat-grind) and the [1.5" Carver Knife](https://mountainwoodcarvers.com/products/copy-of-occt-original-walnut-carver-1-3-4-flat-grind), both in Walnut and made from O1 tool steel. These are excellent knives and well worth the money.
- [BeaverCraft Whittling Knife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WCH6T4) - $13: This was my first carving knife, and I *hate* it. The blade is double the thickness of the Flexcut, making it insufferably hard to use. I also own their strop, and it was a waste of money. Avoid BeaverCraft tools.

### Maintenance
Your knives will get dull, no matter how expensive they are. If you get into wood carving and decide to stay with the hobby, invest in a balsa strop and diamond compound for about $20. If you carve a lot, you should also, consider getting a 3000-5000 grit stone. Check out my post on [Japanese Whetstones]({% link _posts/2024-08-11-whetstones.md %}) for specific recommendations.

## My Projects
My first projects were simple practice exercises. You can see how I practiced stop cuts and chip cuts, and I also carved a star and a sphere. The stop cuts help you get a feel for the technique, the star solidifies your ability to make strong and accurate cuts, and the sphere is a great, if tedious, exercise in control.

After the introductory exercises, my  first real project was a wizard ornament. You can keep these simple or add more detail. I’ve made two, and I prefer the low-poly version to the more detailed one.

I also tried carving a little man, which was a lot for a first serious attempt, but it was a great learning experience. The details in his tiny hands, smaller than a pinky nail, are particularly satisfying, especially his right index finger and thumb. However, you can see clear signs of my early lack of skill, such as the flat arms protruding awkwardly from the body. This is easy to fix with a couple of undercuts, but I hadn’t fully grasped this technique at the time.

My owl carving might be my favorite. The little feathers give it so much character. These particular photos also make clear how big of a difference lighting and shadows can make in a photo. Often the harsher the lighting, the more dynamic and three dimensional the carving looks.

The grasshopper was my first carving done entirely by eye without following a tutorial video, and I’m really pleased with how it turned out.

There's something simply delightful about the rotund softness of a wooden bear. Although I did this carving just to goof off, I think it ended up being one of my favorites. Take special note of the dimensionality of the arms, compared to the little man that I did earlier. By this point, I had watched many more of Doug's videos and had better understanding of how to undercut the arms for a more realistic look.

I also made some quick videos of my carvings on a rotating stand, which is a fun way to view them from all angles.
