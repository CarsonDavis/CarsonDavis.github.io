## Resources

- [Artifact Map](https://africanfossils.org/artifact-map)
  - this is a great interactive map of fossil locations. really fasinating how many are in kenya around that one single lake. and yet, there are still occassional fossils from across the continent
  - [another map](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Africa-showing-the-distribution-of-fossil-hominin-sites_fig1_371747508) with simpler labels

## Homo neanderthalensis
### La Ferrassie 1
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab: Jorge Zárate](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthal-c5b18842080f479889fb04133c5f701f) - this is the one that I printed
  - [Bone Clones info (BH-019)](https://boneclones.com/product/homo-neanderthalensis-skull-la-ferrassie-1-BH-019)

**Scaling**
- I printed two of these. One at y:~100mm, and one matching a more reasonable GOL. I can't seem to find my source but, I measured the print at ~101mm GOL. Note that this gives a much larger y.

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed 
- Scale: used actual GOL?

### Shanidar 1
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/neanderthal-skull-9b3c92418e564edc8cc84dda42e6c761)

  - Location: files/neandertal/shanindar-reconstruction/neanderthal_skull.stl

**Scaling worksheet**
- This was one of my first prints and I didn't know what I was doing, so I used a y:97.5, which is much too small.

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed  
- Scale: printed at y:97.5 mm  
- Open issues: Hugely difficult skull to paint, but would be nice to print actual size in the future.

### La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 (LCS 1)

  - [“Crâne de Néandertal”](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-de-neandertal-ce29a98485a148bd928d5d43886fb577)
  - [Another model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-433rp7-94d6d0d89da44fae9201dbaf5250d6dc)

**Decision**
- Status: ⭐ Wishlist
- Rationale: this is a cool one, missing a bunch of teeth, has a massive chunk missing from the top of the cranium, otherwise a very complete skull


## Homo erectus

### Homo erectus georgicus D2700
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab (with jaw)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-georgicus-438a06818f954f8191da677303ac7987)

**Scaling worksheet**
- http://hesp.irmacs.sfu.ca/sites/hesp.irmacs.sfu.ca/files/lordkipanidze_et_al_2013_science.pdf
  - this is a good paper, has info for 5 different skulls from Dmanisi Georgia, but sadly only measurements on D4500, not my D2700
- Rotated skull and sliced off the front to measure actual GOL: 165 / 2 = 83.5 mm  
- This gives a y:65.84 mm and a scale of 467.61%  
- Based on the estimated cranial capacity of ~560 cc, it looks right next to La Ferrassie on the print bed

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed

### Sawyer Reconstruction
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-skull-d645e45ff307403e9d2073a6390fc353)

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed
- Scale: too small - printed this before I understood how to do the measurements

### Sangiran 17
**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab (Sangiran 17)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-pithecanthrope-de-javasangiran17-e2e8335158e942448f5ac879e8067602) — nice 75% cranium from Sangiran 17; printed this one; scaled from the site
- **Reference**
  - [MorphoSource](https://www.morphosource.org/media/000005791) — partial reconstruction of Sangiran 17, not the one that I printed

**Measurements (published)**
- GOL: 206 mm (Gordon et al. 2008, PNAS supp.)  
- XCB: 161 mm (same source)

**Scaling worksheet**
- Full-size model's GOL ~201 mm → close enough to the published 206 mm from https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf 

**Notes**
this is one of the first big skulls that i trusted the measurement of. notes at the time read: the size of the model on this one compared to my two habilis skulls is insanley huge, at x:71.5. what's freaking crazy tho is the measurements from https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf give an XCB of fucking 161. at this point I simply don't care, i can't keep obsessing. i'll print it as is, at 50%, which is supposedly even smaller than the real skull

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed
- Scale: 50% of model scale

---

### Trinil 2 (skull cap)
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-trinil-2-1979rp4-b83a24e9d57143b3a3257058f1b16eb9) — interesting skull cap with a strange base

**Decision**
- Status: ⭐ Wishlist  
- Rationale: intriguing partial specimen; worth printing later to compare with Sangiran 17’s vault structure

### Zhoukoudian III (“Peking Man” skullcap)
**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-erectus-pekinensis-skullcap-60ef90a4f4c742ee95786e6ee0d68b38) — weird FBX format, seems correctly scaled; printed at 50%. Includes brow ridge and left side of skull, no face, large sutures  
  - Description from page:  
    > “A scan of a rare replica from the 1930s of the Zhoukoudian III Homo erectus pekinensis skull. Sadly the temporal and sphenoid bones on the right have been lost on the replica. The original fossils of the Zhoukoudian skull have been lost before WWII. Only a number of replicas now remain. This species of human lived during the Middle Pleistocene in northern China. Also known as Peking Man.”

**Scaling worksheet**
- Appeared correctly scaled from source  
- Printed at 50% of original model scale

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed
- Scale: 50%


## Australopithicus sediba
https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000010462
wrote down 145 for the juvenile length
- XCB: 109
mine's width is about ~50mm, so a little too small

## Australopithicus africanus

### Taung Child
- Lenght: 131mm 
based on skulls unlimited [measurement](https://www.skullsunlimited.com/products/replica-taung-child-skull-3-pieces-bh-016)

There's another one that i want to print, the [taung brain](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-taung25011rp11-1-0cc121b94edc4a409e4e3862254e729a). Super detailed and really fucking cool. should do it full sized. [face also](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-enfant-de-taung-1b53441de0d9454eaeae48ad2f37e0cf) [face and jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/primates-australopithecus-africanus-ac715114f43040769389a086a5635929)

https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-taung25011rp11-3-8a798e831fc54b0684cb7a05ce89dbd3 jaw

### Miss Ples
[miss ples](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-africanus-miss-ples-93977b694cb74913ad5bec38ea2f9610) no sizing on this one, but decent model. this is the one that i printed

[paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2409098) says x:139, but when i use that value it is insanely too big. compared to my aethiopicus model, which has a cc of 410 and ples, which has a cc of 485
printed at x: 56

Length: 195mm
this one was correctly scaled and i just resized the model
Pan troglodytes
Location: Africa.
Age: modern.
Dimensions: length, 195 mm; width, 130 mm; height, 105 mm.
Notes: RLA catalog no. 2501.1rp4-1 (cast). Male chimpanzee cranium. 


this is the big chimp that david printed for me https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000102641

[juvenile](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/chimpanzee-skull-6ef86b9a368d4058b67f0c99a7880fb4) would really love to print this one or one like it, but this model is fucky and needs fixing

## Tchadensis
Link: [Sketchfab: Museo [UV] Historia Natural](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast-08a5eb1ecef444d3a5f13bf5a2818923)
Location: files/sahelanthropus-tchandensis/museo_historia_natural/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast/
Length: 183mm, based on the nature paper
the model was sized at 181.55, and so i printed a 50% scale of that

## Homo Florensis
- [should print](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-floresiensis-crane-et-mandibule-97b4975b1464401a824c6513234dd45a)
  - this is a scaled cranum with jaw. and it looks like it is even higher quality than the one that i printed, with deep sutures


## Homo heidelbergensis

### Steinheim skull
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-steinheim-skull1979rp45-e4220013e3d3454d9b7492d47116fe86) — really nicely broken, should print this one

  meningioma tumor

**Scaling**
- model page said y197 x129 z131, so I did x:64.5, which gave 1974.87%

**Decision**
- Status: Printed
- Rationale: good broken detail, adds variation compared to more complete crania

---

### Atapuerca 5
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-8b07fb8f41a74d589be05e7152a79612) — great detail, includes jaw

Scale
https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1006/jhev.1997.0133
the published GOL here is 185, so after rotating the skull and cutting we get a y:92.5. this gives an x:73.73 and a scale of 761.32

**Decision**
- Status: ⭐ Wishlist  
- Rationale: detailed specimen, but not top priority — eventually worth printing
- I think this is the same as the erectus with a jaw that i printed??

### Broken Hill (Rhodesian Man)
**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-sapiens-25011rp35-cranium-96ce6fa86a01479d907f7032e3e8f9b1) - has a neat broken left side that I can paint black, cast number RLA 2501.1rp35
- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab (alternative)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-broken-hill-1979rp9-91c4a28787c04df39540a290528794fa) — this had more detail, but reconstructed

**Scaling notes**
- Dimensions listed on site: 231 × 145 × 145 mm — seemed huge  
- Printed instead at same size as my Neanderthal skulls (~100 mm long)
- PPS: Looking back later, it's possible these big sizes were correct. It seems a lot of them really are supposed to be in the 70s for XCB
- My measurment of the printed model is ~61 at the widest x

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed (scaled to ~100 mm long)  
- Rationale: scaled for comparability rather than absolute dimensions  
- Open issues: might consider reprinting this the correct size...

## Paranthropus boisei

### OH 5 “Zinj”
**Comparative value:** Classic type specimen of boisei, important for showing robust cranial and dental traits.

**Links**
- **Printed**

- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology (2501.1rp10, mislabeled as robustus)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-robustus-25011rp10-0b541e124a8e41c285020329ef000283) — really nice type specimen, excellent ridge, Despite the title, this is not robustus but boisei. Sadly, I didn't realize this at the time and so printed the other one.
  - [morphosource](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005731?locale=en). this looks really damn high quality. should request this if i decide to do any full sized prints

**Scaling worksheet**
- Anchor metric: none used yet  
- Model scale: printed as-is  

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed (from 2501.1rp74-1 model)   
- Scale: not sure how I scaled this one, as the model loaded tiny. the final print has a measured x: 71.38
- Open issues: revisit mislabeled higher-quality scan if reprinting

**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [African Fossils](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-732?o=1) — half-face fragment, looks awesome. final analysis, this is the higher quality one

## Paranthropus robustus

### SK 48

**Scaling worksheet**
- printed at x: 71.63 mm  
- Published bizygomatic breadth: 143 mm  

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed  
- Rationale: scaled against breadth values; result is ~84–91 mm at half size  
- Open issues: could reprint at full size to match published bizygomatic breadth

this is a pretty neat and very high quality x-rayed cranium fragment with tons of interesting fractures

https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000163331?locale=en
here is the face from the same individual. also seems to be the right scale 
search for 000163331 in downloads. this is the one i tried to print and had some trouble with. it's a pretty cool piece, should definitely be one of the first fragments on my list to print.

### DNH 7 (female)
**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab: LTUArchaeology](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dnh-7-paranthropus-robustus-female-c581173550444e5e95d2dc9df611c450) — tons of cracks in the top of the skull, female, no ridge

**Scaling worksheet**
- x (slicer): 63.02 mm (at 50% of model size)  
- Appears accurate at that scaling

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed  
- Rationale: good female counterpart to SK 48, excellent surface detail with cracks  
- Notes: wonderful missing chunks on the top of the skull


## Paranthropus aethiopicus

[Geoffrey Marchal](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-b45efcb8b6fa459bb7f0e5726ac1d3e7)
ok, so this one didn't have a scale, but the two other ones did have a scale, so i copied their dimensions
[one](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-25011rp19-333ebef7b3c04af8b87c3ee7467b5470)
[two](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-f799f267330f4d2d994b154581074344)

- x: 75mm

note that the usual RLA that i print from didn't actually have the best quality model, instead Geoffrey did. I went to his page do see if he had any other good models, but there were only a couple. Need to recheck what they were.



## Keyanthropus platyops
costs $4 and might be open, maybe hold off on this one https://www.fab.com/listings/78029783-d33d-48f6-bcc5-db3d2fe5d08c
the other one on sketchfab is also open

[YES](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-40000-)
excellent, excellent, excellent
- it came already scaled, the final half x is 65.46. this is what i printed
- after printing, the front came off. need to recheck the model and see if i broke it or how to fix it
- ok, so this wasn't able to pprint correctly. i pulled it into onshape and created a file called "KNMWT 40000 - strong supports.stl" which is in documents/3d...

## Afarensis
[sizing](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-cranium-4562f063aba647d290abb5808d66f20a) ugly model, but has okish looking sizing (x: 56*2)

[good?](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826086/files)this looks suprisingly good? it seems to be a reconstruction but with nice texture in the model. should give this a second look at hink about printingif

[morphosource](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005729?locale=en). this is an xray, like the other morphosources from douglas boyer. need to request. pretty major reconstruction, but has definitely good details

## Rudolfensis

[uliege](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-rudolfensis-efdb526f504842828d4e6133cf8b5f02) 
- KMN ER-1470

# Still Need to Print


## Aegyptopithecus zeuxis

## Gorllia
[skull with jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gorilla-sp-male-crane-et-mandibule-9a37fbf556bd4f52b0b98ec3b9e3ad5b) should look for somethinglike this to print


https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000102891?locale=en
weird skull with wierd crest. search for the number to find the file

## Ardipithecus ramidus

[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-cranium-1b55fb758d164a60bab6a7d57f750b01)
[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-mandible-758bdb9201834f2eab61323ba0e786c3)
- this is the only one that is on sketchfab. decent detail, not scaled correctly

ok, so ardi is supposedly ~325 cc compared to habilis 1813 of ~500. also, is it supposedly similar to a chimp, but smaller than some, which can hit as high as 450. so anyway, my chimp skull is 65 so i made it 58 bc i felt like it. i want it to not be crazy bigger than paranthropus, which it is definitely going to dwarf. i don't fucking know man.. anyway, this is scaled at 160%


## Homo ergaster
Turkana child

[fragment](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-cranium-f461dbb45add4a0d944060b2d0a49f78)
this appears to be KNM ER 3883 - i think i printed this

[turkan child](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-skull-turkana-child-0ef67e21a9ab43d483134d8edd6535b4)

i have no fucking idea on either of these sizes. i looked up the brain volumes and they are 
- sanigran 17: 1004
- 1813: 510
- 3883: 804-845
- 15000: 880
(i printed all these at the same time). basically, 17 was scaled and seems to match the literature, and so was 1813. so i but the two ergaster as slightly smaller, at x:65. with turkana being 253% and 3883 at 2243%.

## Habilis
[real fossil](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-1813?o=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com) good features, but not high poly KNMER 1813. it also seems to be sized correctly. x:55 at 50%
africanfossils lists Dimensions:  x=168.00; y=112.00; z=114.00 mm
boneclones lists as 171,118,116
paper gives the XCB as 113mm, or 56.5
i'm printing at 56.5, or 271.71% scale
whoa - https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005965. need to revist this print. super high qlality of this fossil i think. i have requested for download. 


[twiggy, OH 24](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-twiggy-255074b073074c81a2d9764dc8ff21a2) decent. once you slice it it's not bad x:58 @50%
the paper gives the XCB as 120mm, or 60
i'm printing at x:60, or scale 51.37% (actually, i'm going to revisit this one later, still need to print this one)

need to look at bone clones to see how to paint this one https://boneclones.com/product/homo-habilis-skull-oh-24-BH-010



[great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-0c7485037f7b4511a470c32b05aa5912) also 1813, but missing two teeth?

[also great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/skull-replica-homo-habilis-f1bb5aedac164a5c82ae8ba775cc7e9d) this one has the missing teeth?? need to see what the deal is, maybe they were broken off that one museums cast or something...

[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/laetoli-footprints-65a1ec6d0af740fe97189bd761055a60)
Def need to print these. Made 3.66 million years ago in volcanic ash in tanzania, probably by australopithecus afarensis.

## Femurs

they are located in this folder, the gcode is. 5h 12m
- erectus
- [afarensis](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-25011rp17-femur-a9f94a4c008a435792b1edfad9b8783f)
- chimp
- [human](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/human-femur-a9c1f1a88b104c3fbfe975fa10b31b31)

all of them were sized by the model itself

## Naledi
[skull cap](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000084599?locale=en) this is neat, seems to be sized correctly - WITS - Lesedi Chamber - U.W. 102a-011
[skull with jawa](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000054666?locale=en) seems to be sized correctly too - LES1 - Homo naledi 'Neo' - Reconstruction of cranium 


- i'm printing both of these at their actual listed sizes

## Hippo

[fuck yes](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hippopotamus-skull-27445833d318446abf254a96c24a9bcf) - dear god, i must print this


## Tiktaalik
[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tiktaalik-roseae-4bcd9214503e402d88014f6a37297154) awesome skan, but probably won't actually be printable
