## Resources

- [Artifact Map](https://africanfossils.org/artifact-map)
  - this is a great interactive map of fossil locations. really fasinating how many are in kenya around that one single lake. and yet, there are still occassional fossils from across the continent
  - [another map](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Africa-showing-the-distribution-of-fossil-hominin-sites_fig1_371747508) with simpler labels 
- Smithsonian
  - [mystery skull interactive](https://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/mystery-skull-interactive)
- [fossil comparisons](https://archaeology.sites.unc.edu/home/ca/teaching-resources/anth-148-human-origins/recitation-5-fossil-hominins/r5-station-1/)
[TEETH](https://human-fossil-record.org/index.php?/category/5549)
- [digital atlas](https://www.museumoftheearth.org/human-origins/3d-models) nice page with interactive models through evolutionary time. definitely should start here and then go to the learn more section as I begin writing about each skull

## Download Sites
### Worthwhile Sites
- [Sketchfab]() - best site I know of. tons of great models, but not always available for download
- [Morphosource]() - when they have the model, this is the best by far. Many x-ray scans with insane detail. Also incredible for modern crania
- [africanfossils](https://africanfossils.org/search) - not the biggest collection, but they have pretty decent scans of actual fossils and fragments
- [yeggi](https://www.yeggi.com/) - search aggregator, decent search
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/) - small selection, but worth checking
- [nepos](https://archiv.neanderthal.de/) - might be good? i've signed up for it

### Dead Sites
- [DigiMorph](https://digimorph.org/resources/STLs.phtml) - made back in 2006, this used to have ct scans specifically ready for 3d printing, but they no longer seem to have any live links
- [cgtrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/) - high prices
- [turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) - high prices, and sells skulls that are free elsewhere
- [free3d](https://free3d.com/) - nothing good
- [Smithsonian 3d Digitization](https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/australopithecus-afarensis-cranium) - nothing actually available for download here

### Unavailable But Promising
Weinert (1936), Der Urmenschenschädel von Steinheim (Z. Morphol. Anthropol. 35:463–518)
- Probably has the Steinheim GOL, never mind I found it

## Homo neanderthalensis
### La Ferrassie 1

  - [richardcynanjones, neanderthalskull](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/neanderthal-skull-6464cda832bb4a19bfb34fb146e52154) - has a nice jaw, might need some work on the cracks in blender


**Scaling**
- I printed two of these. One at y:~100mm, and one matching a more reasonable GOL. I can't seem to find my source but, I measured the print at ~101mm GOL. Note that this gives a much larger y.

file in folder. GOL from gordon is 208mm

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed 
- Scale: used actual GOL?

  - Location: files/neandertal/shanindar-reconstruction/neanderthal_skull.stl

**Scaling worksheet**
- This was one of my first prints and I didn't know what I was doing, so I used a y:97.5, which is much too small.
file in final folder. 

scale update: gordon GOL: 207.2, scale looks absolutely perfect

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed  
- Scale: printed at y:97.5 mm  
- Open issues: Hugely difficult skull to paint, but would be nice to print actual size in the future.

  - [“Crâne de Néandertal”](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crane-de-neandertal-ce29a98485a148bd928d5d43886fb577)
  - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-cranium-d1c26eba568f4c1098e5434c992b54b7 - no scale (this is the one to print)
  - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-mandible-61757a736c2849a98824550fca19509d - jaw (should go with the no scale, but it has DIFFERENT SCALE. 125 seems close, but ultimatedly i decided not to print)
  - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/primate-homo-neanderthalensis-cf6caab2981d423582ef14bec9fefd0c - with jaw. might revist if i feel like a single piece. the jaw is really nice, you can see how the teeth are missing during life
  - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-433rp7-94d6d0d89da44fae9201dbaf5250d6dc - not really as good

https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf lists 206 for the GOL. doing the normal rotate and cut, this gives us an x: 75.8
file in final folder

**Decision**
- Status: ⭐ printing
- Rationale: this is a cool one, missing a bunch of teeth, has a massive chunk missing from the top of the cranium, otherwise a very complete skull

[Engis2](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/engis2-the-neanderthal-child-of-belgium-c5ca8c0a08f24939b4a51040e33cc417) - partial child cranium, really cool (first neandertal ever discovered?) - definitely not the right scale, although it is the right order of magnitude. welp, i stand corrected. the expected 50% GOL is 88, and my GOL at 50% is 88.88, so i'll keep it at 50%

https://biblio.naturalsciences.be/associated_publications/anthropologica-prehistorica/bulletin-de-la-societe-royale-belge-d-anthropologie-et-de-prehistoire/ap-094-1983/ap94_51-75.pdf - GOL 176



## teshik-tash child
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-skull-80d3195e886d4afc8c5827d2f34511bb

**scale**
- https://www.jstor.org/stable/3628554 - "the greatest breadth of the skull is 125", brain volume estimated at 1490cc
- [bone clones](https://boneclones.com/product/homo-neanderthalensis-child-skull-teshik-tash-BH-027?utm_source=chatgpt.com) - gives a width of 139cm 
- so, imo if the cc is correct, there is no way that breadth measurement from the paper is right. 
- meanwhile, if we take the width from bone clones, we get a very reasonable looking cc compared to the ~1620 LCS 1 
- https://biblio.naturalsciences.be/associated_publications/anthropologica-prehistorica/bulletin-de-la-societe-royale-belge-d-anthropologie-et-de-prehistoire/ap-094-1983/ap94_51-75.pdf ok, this has a nice table which includes both the engis 2 and the taeshik. the GOL is 185. this actually looks really excellent, and gives an x: of 71.5 at a scale of 219.77%

gibraltar 1
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-gibraltar-1-1979rp35-1dd9654eb62347a88452accf4373cc98 - i think this is the right scale? at a minimum, the size on the bed matches the size listed in the description. it also scales about the same as LCS 1

mt circeo 1g
- https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-neanderthalensis-mt-circeo-1-1979rp36-10c83a34e13749b1b88fc78c4d4722fb - not on bed, very smooth model, don't love it

## Homo erectus
### Dmanisi
Here are the published GOLs (glabella–opisthocranion lengths):

Skull 5 (D4500): 165 mm. Reported in Table 1 of Lordkipanidze et al. (2013, Science). 
hesp.irmacs.sfu.ca. x: 138.9

Skull 4 (D3444): 163 mm. Listed as “Cranial length” in Table 1 for the Dmanisi crania. x: 136.4
figures.academia-assets.com

skull 3, 2700: 155mm 

Skull 2 (D2282): can't find this one. from the diagrams, it is about the same as skull 5, a little larger. smaller than skull 1 tho. so inbetween 165-177. maybe call it 170. there is a diagram that i could measure off of. it's pretty wierd that they left this mearusement out of the table. 
ah, here we go: https://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/engels/Stanley/Textbook_update/Science_297/Vekua-02.pdf. marks as 167 approximated. x: 140.89

so, all of these are pretty strange. i ended up resizing them to 98.39, 95.84, 90.47% 2,4,5 respectively. there is a ct image in the paper, and tbh, neither scaling is blatantly incorrect to the eye, 100, 100, 100 or what i have. ok, actualy i took some caliper measurements, and my scales seem closer. YOLO, i'm using mine

**Scaling worksheet**
- http://hesp.irmacs.sfu.ca/sites/hesp.irmacs.sfu.ca/files/lordkipanidze_et_al_2013_science.pdf
  - this is a good paper, has info for 5 different skulls from Dmanisi Georgia, but sadly only measurements on D4500, not my D2700
- Rotated skull and sliced off the front to measure actual GOL: 165 / 2 = 83.5 mm  
- This gives a y:65.84 mm and a scale of 467.61%  
- Based on the estimated cranial capacity of ~560 cc, it looks right next to La Ferrassie on the print bed

- XCB: 161 mm (same source)

**Scaling worksheet**
- Full-size model's GOL ~201 mm → close enough to the published 206 mm from https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf 

**Notes**
this is one of the first big skulls that i trusted the measurement of. notes at the time read: the size of the model on this one compared to my two habilis skulls is insanley huge, at x:71.5. what's freaking crazy tho is the measurements from https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/Gordonetal2008PNASsupplemental.pdf give an XCB of fucking 161. at this point I simply don't care, i can't keep obsessing. i'll print it as is, at 50%, which is supposedly even smaller than the real skull

**Decision**

[paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2409098) says x:139, but when i use that value it is insanely too big. compared to my aethiopicus model, which has a cc of 410 and ples, which has a cc of 485

Length: 195mm
this one was correctly scaled and i just resized the model
Pan troglodytes
Location: Africa.
Age: modern.
Dimensions: length, 195 mm; width, 130 mm; height, 105 mm.
Notes: RLA catalog no. 2501.1rp4-1 (cast). Male chimpanzee cranium. 


this is the big chimp that david printed for me https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000102641

[juvenile](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/chimpanzee-skull-6ef86b9a368d4058b67f0c99a7880fb4) would really love to print this one or one like it, but this model is fucky and needs fixing

## Tchadensis
Link: [Sketchfab: Museo [UV] Historia Natural](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast-08a5eb1ecef444d3a5f13bf5a2818923)
Location: files/sahelanthropus-tchandensis/museo_historia_natural/sahelanthropus-tchadensis-skull-cast/
Length: 183mm, based on the nature paper
the model was sized at 181.55, and so i printed a 50% scale of that

ok, so https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382115698_The_taxonomy_of_Sahelanthropus_tchadensis_from_a_craniometric_perspective has some nice tables. it quotes from: https://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/nature03397. it has a much larger GOL than the fossil scan at 173mm. i don't think this is correct

ok, here is the original paper from brunet, and it has a photo with a scale https://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/nature00879
measurement off the image gives me a rough GOL of 155mm of the non-reconstructed fossil. the GOL of the model is roughly 158, so i will keep the scale as is


## Homo Florensis
- [should print](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-floresiensis-crane-et-mandibule-97b4975b1464401a824c6513234dd45a)
  - this is a scaled cranum with jaw. and it looks like it is even higher quality than the one that i printed, with deep sutures
ok, so although this seems scaled, the GOL is 130, whereas Gordon publishes 143. So I scaled the model to actual 143, which was 110.05%

https://os.pennds.org/archaeobib_filestore/pdf_articles/JHE/2011_61_6_Kaifuetal.pdf
excellent write up on the skull. notes that there are two GOLs, 139 and 143. it's a 40 page paper, really great, need to read



scale marker which is 100 is 45.82
the 139 is 59.78
the ??? is 62.63

  meningioma tumor

  read this: https://www.johnhawks.net/p/a-look-at-the-fossil-skull-from-steinheim, has the story

fuck yes. this has a diagram where they have caliper readings. the diagram measures 187mm, which is 188.8 compared to how i usually do GOL. also, the model is perfectly sized already, matching the 187 from the diagram when oriented the same way
https://www.academia.edu/72751586/Die_Defekt_und_Verformungsspuren_am_Sch%C3%A4del_des_Urmenschen_von_Steinheim_an_der_Murr

**Scaling**
- model page said y197 x129 z131, so I did x:64.5, which gave 1974.87% (seems like prusa doesn't always bring in the right size?)

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed
- Rationale: good broken detail, adds variation compared to more complete crania

- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-heidelbergensis-8b07fb8f41a74d589be05e7152a79612) — great detail, includes jaw

Scale
https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1006/jhev.1997.0133
the published GOL here is 185, so after rotating the skull and cutting we get a y:92.5. this gives an x:73.73 and a scale of 761.32

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed 
- Rationale: detailed specimen, but not top priority — eventually worth printing
- I think this is the same as the erectus with a jaw that i printed??

  - [morpho](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005747) - possibly the most detail of all. reconstructed. would need to request from douglas

**Scaling notes**
- Dimensions listed on site: 231 × 145 × 145 mm — seemed huge  
- Printed instead at same size as my Neanderthal skulls (~100 mm long)
- PPS: Looking back later, it's possible these big sizes were correct. It seems a lot of them really are supposed to be in the 70s for XCB
- My measurment of the printed model is ~61 at the widest x

**Scaling Notes: Updated**
So, both of the models have the same size on the bed. I measured the GOL and it clocks in at 213mm at 100% scale for the RLA reconstruction. Gordon has this marked at 206mm, so I have scaled slightly to 96.75% to match this GOL measurement
ok, so i have two of these from different sources, and they are scaled identically, so i'm just keeping their scales

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed
- Scaled to ~100 mm long 
- Rationale: scaled for comparability rather than absolute dimensions  
- Open issues: might consider reprinting this the correct size...

## Paranthropus boisei

### OH 5 “Zinj”
**Comparative value:** Classic type specimen of boisei, important for showing robust cranial and dental traits.

**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology (2501.1rp74-1)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-boisei-25011rp74-1-cranium-9b0fe239afbc49e9a2bec1bb05dbd55c) — this is the one I printed, no scale? totally has a scale, must have been prusa. later prints i checked and the GOL of the model is 172, so dead on.

- **Reference**
  - [Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology (2501.1rp10, mislabeled as robustus)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-robustus-25011rp10-0b541e124a8e41c285020329ef000283) — really nice type specimen, excellent ridge, Despite the title, this is not robustus but boisei. Sadly, I didn't realize this at the time and so printed the other one.
  - [morphosource](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005731?locale=en). this looks really damn high quality. should request this if i decide to do any full sized prints

**Scaling worksheet**
- Scale: not sure how I scaled this one, as the model loaded tiny. the final print has a measured x: 71.38
gordon says 173mm GOL, and 143mm XCB

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed (from 2501.1rp74-1 model)   
- Open issues: revisit mislabeled higher-quality scan if reprinting. also scale correctly...

### KNM-ER 732 (face fragment)
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [African Fossils](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-732?o=1) — half-face fragment, looks awesome. final analysis, this is the higher quality one. i think i have this one in the folder now, but might be the other one, haven't checked
  - [Sketchfab (2501.1rp46)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-boisei-25011rp46-fb12e13b384b48609a5c0a0bf29591ee) — same fragment, might be higher quality

has been printed
Scale
Both of these had the same size, so i trust it

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed  
- Rationale: really cool fragment of the entire left side of the face and some of the skull cap

---
https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005786?locale=en
mandible
need to request download. this looks pretty nice. graet to compare the jaws and teeth

### KNM-ER 3230 (jaws)
**Links**
- **Reference**
  - [African Fossils](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-3230?o=1) — jaws and parts


**Decision**
- Status: ⭐ Wishlist  
- Rationale: this will be nice when I get around to printing lower jaws.

**Scaling**
- printed at 50%, looks pretty accurate

**Decision**
- Status: ✅ Printed
- Rationale: distinctive anatomical fragment, really like this one as a quiz piece


## Paranthropus robustus

### SK 48
**Links**
- **Printed**
  - [Sketchfab: RLA Archaeology](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-robustus-25011rp23-63b6f246e55e411492bb8a4615f2bee0) — maybe the most interesting specimen, missing many teeth, smashed skull, slight ridge. cast number RLA 2501.1rp23



**Scaling worksheet**
- printed at x: 71.63 mm  
- Published bizygomatic breadth: 143 mm  

**scaling revisited**
model page reads 178x147x102. basically, the measurement to trust here is the width (get the eyes level and then scale it), and then you can rotate it until it is flat and the other two come out exactly as advertised. i haven't yet looked up the GOL for this guy, since the RLA numbers tend to be accurate, but i will do this when i print full size.

**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed  
- Rationale: scaled against breadth values; result is ~84–91 mm at half size  
- Open issues: could reprint at full size to match published bizygomatic breadth

https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000163333?locale=en
DNH-7-Vault.stl
this is a pretty neat and very high quality x-rayed cranium fragment with tons of interesting fractures. definitely should add this to the list to print

https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000163331?locale=en
here is the face from the same individual. also seems to be the right scale 
search for 000163331 in downloads. this is the one i tried to print and had some trouble with. it's a pretty cool piece, should definitely be one of the first fragments on my list to print.

  - [Sketchfab: LTUArchaeology](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dnh-7-paranthropus-robustus-female-c581173550444e5e95d2dc9df611c450) — tons of cracks in the top of the skull, female, no ridge

**Scaling worksheet**
- x (slicer): 63.02 mm (at 50% of model size)  
- Appears accurate at that scaling

**updated scaleing**
printing the small ones at 50% too


**Decision**
- Final print: ✅ Printed  
- Rationale: good female counterpart to SK 48, excellent surface detail with cracks  
- Notes: wonderful missing chunks on the top of the skull


## Paranthropus aethiopicus

[Geoffrey Marchal](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-b45efcb8b6fa459bb7f0e5726ac1d3e7)
ok, so this one didn't have a scale, but the two other ones did have a scale, so i copied their dimensions
[one](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-25011rp19-333ebef7b3c04af8b87c3ee7467b5470)
[two](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/paranthropus-aethiopicus-f799f267330f4d2d994b154581074344)

- x: 75mm

note that the usual RLA that i print from didn't actually have the best quality model, instead Geoffrey did. I went to his page do see if he had any other good models, but there were only a couple. Need to recheck what they were.

**updated**
for the small ones, i am actually printing the RLA. it has massively better detail on the bottom. idk. also, i'm keeping the rla scale

## Homo antecesor
[face](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-antecesor-optimizado-skull-fossil-4285b5e74982473c8b14c947d07e4590). this guy has some nice stuff, but it isn't public. he has a website, etc, and i messaged him on his insta https://www.instagram.com/garcia_avila_m. we'll see what comes of it..

still need to look at morpho for this

## Homo Longi
- [Denosivan Harbin Cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/denosivan-harbin-cranium-homo-longidragonman-5a62c69bf0b545a2989a75bea9baffe8)
- [remix](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/denisovan-harbin-cranium-0620fb7e802b4a04bf5bbbb3ae7a9d16) - this is a remix which tries to improve the eyes, etc
- these guys are actively working on this as of literally 7 hours ago, so should probably wait to see how the dust settles
- this seems to be the latest https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dragon-man-homo-longi-denisovan-skull-fc84db0469474423a02c14b774d72250
gonna print this bad boi for now. it is in the folder as dragon man.stl
221.3mm based on https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666675821000552-mmc1.pdf

## Keyanthropus platyops
costs $4 and might be open, maybe hold off on this one https://www.fab.com/listings/78029783-d33d-48f6-bcc5-db3d2fe5d08c
the other one on sketchfab is also open

[YES](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmwt-40000-)
excellent, excellent, excellent
- it came already scaled, the final half x is 65.46. this is what i printed
- after printing, the front came off. need to recheck the model and see if i broke it or how to fix it
- ok, so this wasn't able to pprint correctly. i pulled it into onshape and created a file called "KNMWT 40000 - strong supports.stl" which is in documents/3d...

## Afarensis
[sizing](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-cranium-4562f063aba647d290abb5808d66f20a) ugly model, but has okish looking sizing (x: 56*2)

[good?](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4826086/files)this looks suprisingly good? it seems to be a reconstruction but with nice texture in the model. should give this a second look at hink about printingif

[morphosource](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005729?locale=en). this is an xray, like the other morphosources from douglas boyer. need to request. pretty major reconstruction, but has definitely good details

- (https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/australopithecus-afarensis-skull-reconstruction) paid reconstruction at $11.26. looks pretty nice though

### A.L. 444-2
178mm
Kimbel, W.H., Rak, Y., & Johanson, D.C. (2004).
The Skull of Australopithecus afarensis.
Oxford University Press.
→ In their metric tables (Table 6.2, p. 137), they list GOL = 178 mm for A.L. 444-2.
this is the one i got from florida

this skull comes aligned but not scaled, and this gives 176 in the x direction

## Rudolfensis

[uliege](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-rudolfensis-efdb526f504842828d4e6133cf8b5f02) 
- KMN ER-1470
- sized from the model, x:61.86
model is in the final folder. the model GOL is 156mm. can't find the actual

[fragments](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-25011rp48-1-cranial-fragment-9805e109b6d14a9499485d0672710cbf) buncha fragments from this guy. well, 3. they make up the skull and would be neat to print


# Still Need to Print


## Aegyptopithecus zeuxis
- [link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/aegyptopithecus-zeuxis-crane-et-mandibule-c3364927d7f148e59bf0f65f5680d0b6) this is a nice skull with jaw, should consider it

## Gorllia
[skull with jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gorilla-sp-male-crane-et-mandibule-9a37fbf556bd4f52b0b98ec3b9e3ad5b) should look for somethinglike this to print

[laser](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/gorilla-sp-male-crane-et-mandibule-9a37fbf556bd4f52b0b98ec3b9e3ad5b) this is a laser scan, but it has hollow with nice details? 

https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000102891?locale=en
weird skull with wierd crest. search for the number to find the file

## Ardipithecus ramidus

[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus cranium](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-cranium-1b55fb758d164a60bab6a7d57f750b01)
[Sketchfab: Digital Atlas of Ancient Life: Ardipithecus ramidus jaw](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ardipithecus-ramidus-mandible-758bdb9201834f2eab61323ba0e786c3)
- this is the only one that is on sketchfab. decent detail, not scaled correctly

ok, so ardi is supposedly ~325 cc compared to habilis 1813 of ~500. also, is it supposedly similar to a chimp, but smaller than some, which can hit as high as 450. so anyway, my chimp skull is 65 so i made it 58 bc i felt like it. i want it to not be crazy bigger than paranthropus, which it is definitely going to dwarf. i don't fucking know man.. anyway, this is scaled at 160%


## Homo ergaster
Turkana child

[partial cranium with eyes and face stub](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-cranium-f461dbb45add4a0d944060b2d0a49f78)
this appears to be KNM ER 3883 - i think i printed this

[turkan child](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-skull-turkana-child-0ef67e21a9ab43d483134d8edd6535b4)
model in folder, hard time finding the GOL
also known as KNM-WT 15000
here's a paper with photos of the fossil https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1038/316788a0. i measured off the image and got what seems to be a gol of 165mm. lotta assumptions here tho.
for my most recent prints, i have scaled to a gol of 165 (which is 514.91%) 


i have no fucking idea on either of these sizes. i looked up the brain volumes and they are 
- sanigran 17: 1004
- 1813: 510
- 3883: 804-845
- 15000: 880
(i printed all these at the same time). basically, 17 was scaled and seems to match the literature, and so was 1813. so i but the two ergaster as slightly smaller, at x:65. with turkana being 253% and 3883 at 2243%.


### 3733
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-4ebd93d29e594baa8e85fff95fee9cc3
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-ergaster-55a65f8d568d425e939a94d3d0d81a0d - not available

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249319139_Homo_erectus_and_Middle_Pleistocene_hominins_Brain_size_skull_form_and_species_recognition
GOL 182. so the GOL of the model is 177

## Habilis
### KNM-ER 1813
[real fossil](https://africanfossils.org/hominids/knmer-1813?o=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com) good features, but not high poly KNMER 1813. it also seems to be sized correctly. x:55 at 50%
africanfossils lists Dimensions:  x=168.00; y=112.00; z=114.00 mm
boneclones lists as 171,118,116
paper gives the XCB as 113mm, or 56.5
i'm printing at 56.5, or 271.71% scale
whoa - https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000005965. need to revist this print. super high qlality of this fossil i think. scale looks to be basically dead on of gordon's published 149. interestingly, this seems to be missing part of the eye which I see on other models as being original? 


[great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-0c7485037f7b4511a470c32b05aa5912) also 1813, but missing two teeth?

[also great detail](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/skull-replica-homo-habilis-f1bb5aedac164a5c82ae8ba775cc7e9d) this one has the missing teeth?? need to see what the deal is, maybe they were broken off that one museums cast or something...


### OH 24
[twiggy, OH 24](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-habilis-twiggy-255074b073074c81a2d9764dc8ff21a2) decent. once you slice it it's not bad x:58 @50%
the paper gives the XCB as 120mm, or 60.

i'm printing at x:60, or scale 51.37% (actually, i'm going to revisit this one later, still need to print this one)

need to look at bone clones to see how to paint this one https://boneclones.com/product/homo-habilis-skull-oh-24-BH-010

Gordon gives the GOL as 145. model is ~143 so, totally fine





## Laetoli Footprints
[link](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/laetoli-footprints-65a1ec6d0af740fe97189bd761055a60)
Def need to print these. Made 3.66 million years ago in volcanic ash in tanzania, probably by australopithecus afarensis.

## Femurs

they are located in this folder, the gcode is. 5h 12m
- erectus
- [afarensis](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/australopithecus-afarensis-25011rp17-femur-a9f94a4c008a435792b1edfad9b8783f)
- chimp
- [human](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/human-femur-a9c1f1a88b104c3fbfe975fa10b31b31)

all of them were sized by the model itself

## Naledi
[skull cap](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000084599?locale=en) this is neat, seems to be sized correctly - WITS - Lesedi Chamber - U.W. 102a-011
[skull with jawa](https://www.morphosource.org/concern/media/000054666?locale=en) seems to be sized correctly too - LES1 - Homo naledi 'Neo' - Reconstruction of cranium 
nfenis

- i'm printing both of these at their actual listed sizes

## cats

[fossil lion thing??](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/panthera-gombaszoegensis-8db4f6bff5bd431cb490b2dc6c57fd4a) this is a neat big cat fossil

## Hippo

[fuck yes](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hippopotamus-skull-27445833d318446abf254a96c24a9bcf) - dear god, i must print this


## Tiktaalik

He also has heidelbergensis bodo https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bodo-cranium-38819d5d02fe4db4af22801d43585294, homo idaltu.
this guy lists 215x155x125, and i took measurements off of an image from https://in-africa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Rightmire-1996-JHE-Bodo.pdf to give me 121mm between the two sharp parts of the eye. my scaling gave me 215.8, which is insanely close to his measurement, so i'm happy. 149.28 for my width


there is another idaltu from UCFanthropology https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/homo-sapiens-idaltu-cranium-d1dc845f48c5464292a8351075ed93f5. Need to message them for some of their skulls...
