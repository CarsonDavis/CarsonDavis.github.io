There is something magical about a really, truly sharp knife. I'm not talking about a knife that glides through paper. I'm not talking about a knife that will shave. 

I'm talking about a knife that can casually slice through a limp paper towel. No, I'm talking a knife that can carve the corner of a square of toilet paper without tearing it. 

The kind of knife that that glides through soft bread like it doesn't exist. That makes tomatoes flee in terror.

Most people have never used an actually sharp knife.

Sure! Hereâ€™s the condensed version with bullet points:


### Basics
Starting from the basics, I think an everyday sharpening kit should have at least the following components:
- coarse stone
- fine stone
- flattening stone
- strop

I try to include all of these in every recommendation, with differences in price reflecting a lose of convenience, speed, or quality. At the lowest levels, you have to do without a strop and flattening stone.

### Buy it All
$406 is an atrocious amount of money. But it represents the highest quality option in every category and has every stone you could possibly need. 
#### Stone Flattening
As you use your stones, they will wear unevenly. You use a flattening stone to keep them flat and to resurface them. This makes sharpening easier, more consistent, and more pleasant, improving the feedback of the stone, and often increasing the quality of the results.
- [Atoma 140](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BN32EXY)
- The atoma 140 is the name of the game for flattening stones. It's fast, it's easy, it's effective, and it simply doesn't get any better than this.

#### Major Repairs
I use this infrequently, but when you need it, you need it. It's a coarse stone that can remove a lot of material quickly, such as fixing a broken tip or thinning a blade.
- Shapton Traditional 120

#### **Initial Sharpening**
- Shapton Glass HR 500: Simply my favorite stone for setting the initial bevel on a knife. It's fast, it's hard, it's consistent, and it's a joy to use.
- Stone Holder: The shapton is too thin to use comfortably without a holder

#### **Finishing**
Morihei Hi 4000
Kitayama 8000
Naniwa Gouken 12k

#### **Polishing**
Balsa Strop
Strop Base
Gunny Juice 1um

### Personal Everyday Kit
Having every stone possible for every use case is great, but you can save $150 and get only what I actually use for 95% of my sharpening tasks.

## Recommendations
### Personal Use
details on exactly what I recommend for a full set
- Diamond Flattening Plate
    - [Atoma 140](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BN32EXY) - $55 This is what I actually own.
    - [CKTG 140](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/140grdistflp.html) - $30 I've heard this is functionally as good for half the price.
- Main Stone
    - Shapton Glass HR 500
- Finishing Stone
    - rst
- Strop
    - [Balsa Strop](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/bamapa.html) - $14
    - [Strop Base](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/ristba.html) - $25 (The strop is magnetic, so you might get away without this)
    - [1 micron Diamond Suspension](https://www.gritomatic.com/products/gunny-juice-poly-diamond-emulsion) - $38 

Do not accidently buy the KW65, which will be brown and white. You want the KDS 1000/6000 which is red-brown and tan-brown.
