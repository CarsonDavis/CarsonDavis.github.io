There is something magical about a really, truly sharp knife. I'm not talking about a knife that glides through paper. I'm not talking about a knife that will shave. 

I'm talking about a knife that can casually slice through a limp paper towel. No, a knife that can carve the corner of a square of toilet paper without tearing it. A chef knife that glides soft bread like it doesn't exist. 

Most people have never used an actually sharp knife.
