## Overview
This post is designed to give a prospective buyer a list of high quality sharpening equipment to purchase, at different budgets and for different purposes. Although this will not be a sharpening tutorial, I will attempt to briefly explain the equipment and outline the tradeoffs between price categories.

## Can't I Just Buy the 10 Piece Amazon Special?
No. Dear god no. Please don't. I have tried several, and they are all terrible. They are slow, they wear quickly, they dish easily, they clog, they are inconsistent, they are poorly made, they are poorly graded, they are poorly packaged, they are poorly everything. They make everything about sharpening harder, and you will really, seriously regret owning them. 

Yes, I know they are cheap. Yes, I know they have inexplicably good reviews. And yes, I know they come with 6 stones, a stand, a flattening stone, a strop, and a partridge in a pear tree. But seriously, it's all junk and you don't want it.

Can you technically sharpen a knife with them? Yes. But technically you can also sharpen a knife on a dirty brick from your mom's garden...honestly, using a brick would probably be less infuriating than one of the random off-brand Amazon stones. 

If for some reason you can't find the exact stones I recommend, stick to one of these reputable brands:
- King (Deluxe models only)
- Naniwa Chosera
- Shapton
- Suehiro
- Atoma
- Arashiyama
- Kitayama
- Morihei
- Imanishi
- JNS


## Sharpening Stones
For the average person with a few kitchen knives and maybe a pocket knife or two, a simple two grit set up will suffice. You need a coarser stone to establish the initial edge and a finer stone to refine it and remove the burr. Experienced sharpeners can get away with a single stone, but this is neither optimal nor something I would recommend for a beginner.

Although coarseness is measured by grit, manufacturers do not follow a universal standard, and published grit numbers should only be used as as rough guide, not as law. Your coarse stone should be somewhere between 500-1000 and the fine stone somewhere between 3000-6000.

In this table, I've outlined 3 paths, the Minimum, Upgrade, and My Personal Setup. 

<b>Minimum</b>

The King KDS 1k/6k is an excellent introductory Japanese stone. Although 1k is a little finer than I prefer for edge setting, there is essentially nothing at this price point that can compare to the quality of the King Deluxe. This is a soaking stone, so you will need to let it soak submerged in water for 10-15 minutes before use. It is extremely important that you buy the King Deluxe (KDS) and not any of the standard Kings, such as the KW65, KW45 or any unmarked variants. I own these stones as well, and they are smaller and lower quality.

<b>Upgrade</b>

In this path, the King is replaced with two of my favorite stones, the Shapton Glass 500 and the Rika 5000. Out of my ~25 or so whetstones, the Shapton Glass 500 is simply my favorite. It is a splash and go stone, meaning you can use it immediately without soaking. And is a joy to use, cutting quickly and leaving a great edge. You'll want to only use it for the initial edge setting and for chip repairs, as it is a little greedy for routine sharpening. Meanwhile, the Rika 5000 is a luxurious soaking stone that builds up a creamy slurry and feels simply heavenly under the knife. The 5000 grit is a bit overstated -- realistically it is more like a 3000 grit, which is perfect for kitchen knives.

If you some extra cash to throw at your equipment, these two upgrades are well worth the money.

<b>My Personal Setup</b>

Pulling out all the stops, you can add a $15 stone holder to make you life that much easier when using the Shapton. It is by no means necessary -- a wet paper towel on top of another stone will do just as well -- but it is a nice convenience and what I personally use. Finally, although I do have a real soft spot in my heart for the Rika 5000, I often simply don't have the patience to wait the 15 minutes of soaking that it needs to truly shine. So what I actually end up using is the vaunted Morihei Hi 4000, a crisp splash and go that blends synthetic and natural grinding agents, for a true-to-grit finish. Although I have plenty of higher grit stones, this is my usual stopping place for kitchen knives.

## Stropping
The last step of sharpening is removing the burr, a thin flap of metal left over from the sharpening process. Depending on the steel, the burr can fold over and make an otherwise sharp knife feel dull or it can stand up from the apex and make the knife feel sharp, at least until you use it a bit. Failure to adequately remove the burr is likely one of the roots of the myth that sharp knives don't stay sharp for long.

The solution to burrs is to remove as much as possible during the final forward passes on your finishing stone, and then to polish the final edge with a strop. 

If you are using a diamond-loaded strop, you can also use it to maintain a razor edge in between sharpenings. I will often go months without a real sharpening, only using a strop.

| [Gunny Juice 1um](https://www.gritomatic.com/products/gunny-juice-poly-diamond-emulsion)                   |      |      | $20  |

<b>Minimum</b>

The essence of stopping is a mild abrasive to remove the last vestiges of the burr. If you are at the limits of your budget, you can reach a sorry imitation of stropping by using a piece of cardboard, a pair of jeans, or even a piece of carpet. These are all poor substitutes, but they are better than nothing.

<b>Upgrade</b>

If you do have the money for a real strop, I strongly recommend a balsa wood strop. This may seem odd, considering that leather is the material most commonly associated with stropping, but I have used more than my fair share of regular and exotic leathers, and balsa crushes them all. 

First, balsa is hard, so it doesn't roll over the edge and soften your apex. You can transition all the techniques and muscle memory from regular sharpening to strop the perfect edge. Second, balsa can easily repaired, so if it gets damaged, you can simply sand it to have a fresh surface. Finally, basla does a great job of loading with diamond compound. 

You can probably buy balsa at a craft store, but if you want a purpose built solution, CKTG sells a wonderful magnetic balsa strip that you can attach to an arbitrary metal surface or to the base they sell separately. They also sell a 1 micron diamond paste that is perfect for maintaining a razor edge in between sharpenings.

<b>My Personal Setup</b>

Personally, I spent the extra money to buy the strop base, which is a heavy metal base with rubber feet that makes your stopping experience a dream. I also upgrade from the CKTG diamond paste to the Gunny Juice 1um, which is a poly diamond emulsion that is a more aggressive and a more effective. It's honestly a bit of a splurge unless you are doing a lot of sharpening, but if you want the best, this is it.

## Recommendation Table

If you want to just skip all the words and explanations, here's a table of my recommendations for various budgets. There is a wide range here, from $37 to $406, with some clear tradeoffs. Although on a day to day basis, I use the $262 Pers kit, I think the $179 Alt kit is the best value for most people, giving you everything you need to be a god of sharpening.

Want to know what you are buying? I think an everyday sharpening kit should have at least the following components:
- flattening stone
- sharpening stone
- finishing stone
- strop

I try to include all of these in every recommendation, with differences in price reflecting a lose of convenience, speed, or quality. At the lowest levels, you have to do without a strop and flattening stone.



Diamond
- glued
- embedded
- resin matrix
- vitrified?
Water
- resin bonded (shapton glass, naniwa professional)
- clay based (king, naniwa superstone)
- magnesia (naniwa chosera, shapton pro kuromaku) 
Oil
- aluminum oxide (norton india)
- silicon carbide (norton crystolon)



### Buy it All
$406 is an atrocious amount of money. But it represents the highest quality option in every category and has every stone you could possibly need. 
#### Flattening Stone 
As you use your stones, they will wear unevenly. You use a flattening stone to keep them flat and to resurface them. This makes sharpening easier, more consistent, and more pleasant, improving the feedback of the stone, and often increasing the quality of the results. I recommend two different flattening stones, depending on budget.
- [Atoma 140](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BN32EXY): This is what I personally use. It's fast, it's easy, it's effective, and it simply doesn't get any better than this.
- [CKTG 140](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/140grdistflp.html): I don't own one, but at half the price this is supposed to be a more than acceptable substitute for the Atoma.

Because of the coarseness, you can theoretically use your flattening stone to do thinning or major repairs on damaged knives, however I do not recommend this, as you may now be unevenly wearing your flattening stone.

#### Major Repairs
I only include a major repair stone in the most expensive category, because I think most people will never need it. I only have one because I occasionally restore old knives. It's a coarse stone that can remove a lot of material quickly, such as fixing a broken tip or thinning a blade.
- [Shapton Trad 120](https://www.amazon.com/SHAPTON-Blade-Black-White-Rough/dp/B001TPE1PK)

#### Sharpening Stones
This is the first stone you use on a dull knife. It's not for minor touchups; it's for establishing the initial bevel or removing micro chips.
- [Shapton Glass 500](https://mtckitchen.com/products/shapton-500-glass-sharpening-stone-hr): This is my all-time favorite stone. It is an effortless splash and go that is an absolute joy to use. It plows though steel while still having feedback and control and leaving a great edge. This is one of the most famous and well loved stones you can buy, and it well deserves its reputation. For maximum ease of use, I recommend buying a [Stone Holder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFB2MTI) with this stone, although you can certainly make one easily out of scrap wood.
- [King KDS 1k/6k](https://www.amazon.com/KDS-Combination-Whetstone-Sharpening-Harder/dp/B01BB1ZDVW/): The 1000 grit stone in this combo is perhaps a little strange to compare with the Shapton 500, as it is a soaking stone that cuts slower and leaves a finer edge. However, if you are willing to give it time to soak and don't have the budget to buy both the Shapton and a second finishing stone, this King 1000 will take you a long way.

#### Finishing Stones
I have multiple stones in this category, depending on how your sharpening goals. For fine work such as straight razors, you will want to go all the way to the Naniwa 12k. However for kitchen knives, I stop sharpening at the Morihei Hi 4000 or the Rika 5000.

- [Morihei Hi 4000](https://carbonknifeco.com/products/morihei-suzu-whetstone-4000): This is a wonderful feeling splash and go that blends synthetic and natural grinding agents. I use it as my primary finishing stone for kitchen knives.
- [Rika 5000](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLP4635): This is a soaking stone that leaves a nice matte finish, silky smooth and feels awesome to use. Often said to be more like a 3000 grit in cutting speed. I've developed a suspicion that mine leaves occasional deep scratches, which is irrelevant for the kitchen but matters for razors. It benefits from long soaks, think 15+ minutes, which is the only reason it is not my primary finishing stone.
- [King KDS 1k/6k](https://www.amazon.com/KDS-Combination-Whetstone-Sharpening-Harder/dp/B01BB1ZDVW/): The 6k side of this stone is the cheap alternative to the Morihei Hi 4000 or Rika 5000. To perform best it will need a long soak.
- [Kitayama 8000](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D3VIX0M): This is another famous stone with a well-deserved reputation. It has a silky smooth feel and benefits from a couple minutes of soaking. It is excellent for minor touchups or in a razor progression. 
- [Naniwa Gouken 12k](https://www.amazon.com/NANIWA-Whetstone-KAGAYAKI-NK-2091-Finishing/dp/B01JI9YPPY): This is a relatively expensive, single purpose stone. I literally only use it for razors and nothing else. 

#### **Polishing**
Diamond loaded strops are an absolute game-changer for maintaining a razor edge in between sharpenings. I will often go months without sharpening, only using a strop. They can also make up for leaving a small burr after the finishing step, often allowing you to remove it to get your final egde. 
- [Balsa Strop](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/bamapa.html)
- [Strop Base](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/ristba.html)
- [CKTG Diamond Paste](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/chdipa1mi.html)
- [Gunny Juice  1um](https://www.gritomatic.com/products/gunny-juice-poly-diamond-emulsion)

### Personal Everyday Kit
Having every stone possible for every use case is great, but you can save $150 and get only what I actually use for 95% of my sharpening tasks.


## New category descriptions

### Poor ($37)
This is the bare minimum stone to be able to get a knife sharp.
- **Advantages:**
  - Basic sharpening setup with King KDS 1000/6000.
  - Covers basic sharpening and polishing needs.
  - Much better than any amazon stones. Will sharpen faster and last longer. 
- **Compromises:**
    - Limited versatility and refinement.
    - Lacks tools for heavy material removal. Can't significantly change the geometry of a knife.
    - You won't be able to sharpen razors.
    - You can't use the stone on short notice, it requires a 15 minute soak.

### Min ($57)
This adds a strop and diamond paste for edge refinement. I specifically don't recommend a leather strop, because they are soft they roll over the edge and dull it. A balsa strop, if it gets damaged, can be sanded to have a fresh surface. They're much more forgiving and will give you a much cleaner surface even after making mistakes. This particular one has a magnet on the back so it can attach to the base I recommend in some of the higher upgrade levels.
- **Advantages:**
  - With a strop, you can remove the final burr and end up with a way sharper knife, especially at a beginner skill level.
  - You can quickly strop a knife during regular use to maintain sharpness so you won't have to sharpen as often.

## Recommendations
### Personal Use
details on exactly what I recommend for a full set
- Diamond Flattening Plate
    - [Atoma 140](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BN32EXY) - $55 This is what I actually own.
    - [CKTG 140](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/140grdistflp.html) - $30 I've heard this is functionally as good for half the price.
- Main Stone
    - Shapton Glass HR 500
- Finishing Stone
    - rst
- Strop
    - [Balsa Strop](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/bamapa.html) - $14
    - [Strop Base](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/ristba.html) - $25 (The strop is magnetic, so you might get away without this)
    - [1 micron Diamond Suspension](https://www.gritomatic.com/products/gunny-juice-poly-diamond-emulsion) - $38 

Do not accidently buy the KW65, which will be brown and white. You want the KDS 1000/6000 which is red-brown and tan-brown. 

### Compromise Options 

### Budget Options


## Things to Avoid

Please never, never, buy the Amazon Basics stones. For a tiny bit more money you can get my minimum recommendation, the King KDS 1000/6000, which is a world of difference better.
