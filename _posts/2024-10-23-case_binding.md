## Materials
### Consumables
- parchment paper
- davey board
- glue

### Tools
- olfa knife
- cutting matt
- press
- side press
- bone folder
- square
- paper towels
- glue plate
- 120 sandpaper

## Prep
Cut a bunch of squared pieces of parchment paper


## Preparing the Textblock

1. Sand the spine with 80 or 120 to roughen the surface for gluing. You want to sand first so that you can be rough and not worry about damaging the pages.
2. Cut off most of the original cover, leaving a 2 inch strip, slightly inset from the top and bottom

Often the first page is glued to the cover. You will need to either pull it off the glue so that the cover can be free, or gently score it along the seam and pull it out. Typically this page is not really part of the book, either being blank of with reviews, etc. 

## Endpapers
The grain should travel parallel to the spine of the book
1. cut the endpapers to 2x the size of the textblock
2. fold in half
3. glue underneath the remaining cover, in a 3mm strip

## Cut the Davey Board
We are going to cut everything once slightly oversized, tape it together and try it on the book, then get the final size.
Covers
W = W of textblock + 6mm - 10mm (hinge gap) (might need to take this measurement from the textblock after taping)
L = L of textblock + 6mm

Spine
L = L of textblock + 6mm
W = thickness of textblock + one board thickness

Hinge Gap
Cut a hinge gap spacer
10 mm

Cut a turn in spacer
20 mm


Glue the leather bands to the spine


1. Cut the spine first and then immediately glue the bands to it.
2. While it dries, you can cut the covers


Glue on the head band
Glue on the spine cloth. it goes between the headbands


Materials
- Greyboard
- davey board

## The Case

Size
height = height of the text block + 2x the perimeter, where 3mm is a good size for the perimeter


cut a greyboard square. cut one side with a ruler, the from there use a square to cut the other sides. hold the ruler firmly and cut with multiple passes.
3mm edges around the book (assuming that it is a5 size)

gluing the leather
when cutting the leather, extend 1.5x the board thickness from the corner
you can make the diaganol cut and then pull out the leather

## Endpapers, Gluing the Spine, Trimming the Edges

The endpapers should be the same size as the text block. You can always cut them oversized and then trim them once they are glued on. 

Q: will I have the endpapers be inside of the original cover?
Q: how big do i make the gap, and how to i calculate it?

- cut a slightly oversized endpaper and fold it in half
- use a piece of parmament paper to protect the text block and glue a 1cm strip of the endpaper to the text block
- if you endpapers are not two sided, you might need to back them with another piece of paper before gluing them to the text block



## Casing In

[How to Measure the Corners](https://youtu.be/wApAv8IvGLU?si=kG6tHq-Gz13UCI3E&t=284)
watch from this time stamp. he makes it really easy.
watch the whole video, it is very good.
ffs he makes doing the paper so easy. the fold technique is perfect.

## Avoiding Warped Boards

The side exposed to moisture will expand, and form the top of the curve.

Paper expands across the grain

- the thinner material should receive the adhesive, and the thinner material should be nearer the text block
   - if you put dry paper on a wet board, the thin paper will expand and wrinkle
   - when boards do warp, they should warp in towards the text block, not away from it. therefore the thin, pulling material should be closest to the text block
- PVA is a drier adhesive than paste, so it is less likely to warp the board
- DAS bookbinding doesn't criss cross the grain except when making springbacks

book cloth will stretch more in the grain direction.

## How to find grain direction
Long Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the long side of the paper.
Short Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the short side of the paper.

Grain should be head to tail, meaning parallel to the spine.

Bend it both ways. The way it bends easiest forms the axis that traces the grain direction.
Wet it on one side. A strip cut along the grain will stay straight, but a strip cut across the grain will curl.
You can cut a small slip of paper and wet it.

## Endpapers

- Not as practically informative as some other videos, but an interesting overview of the history and purpose of endpapers.

[Made Endpapers](https://youtu.be/4vN5xSY86iw?si=EI4Vi1TQfCsqTVQ8)
When using a single sided endpaper, you can back it with another piece of paper. You often do this by having two folded sheets (4 leafs) with the interior two glued together (3 final leafs). This can be done by fully gluing the interior pages, created a 'made page', or by gluing only the edge, created a 'flexible made page'





## Materials

[Davey Binders Board](https://www.talasonline.com/Davey-Binders-Board)
I buy 9x11.5, 98pt (0.098in or 2.5mm thick) Davey board. It costs $2 per sheet, is pH neutral, and is long grain. With a thin bookbinding leather, these boards will make premium and robust covers. I'd say that you could go thinner, maybe 90 point, but I wouldn't go any thicker. Even a coffee table sized book would probably be fine with 98pt board.
