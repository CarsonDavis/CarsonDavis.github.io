## Materials
<b>Consumables</b>
- wax paper
- [98pt Davey Binders Board](https://www.talasonline.com/Davey-Binders-Board)

### Tools
- [olfa knife](https://www.amazon.com/OLFA-1075449-Fiberglass-Rubber-Utility/dp/B003UHUZ3M)
- [glue brush](https://www.lineco.com/disposable-glue-brushes.html)
- cutting mat
- press
- side press
- bone folder
- square
- paper towels
- glue plate
- 120 sandpaper

>Davey Board: I buy 9x11.5, 98pt (0.098in or 2.5mm thick) Davey board. It costs $2 per sheet, is pH neutral, and is long grain. With a thin bookbinding leather, these boards will make premium and robust covers. I'd say that you could go thinner, maybe 90 point, but I wouldn't go any thicker. Even a coffee table sized book would probably be fine with 98pt board.

>Blades and Brushes: When buying Olfa blades, the black ones ([ABB-10B](https://www.amazon.com/OLFA-Replacement-Blades-Segments-ABB-10B/dp/B0042XCMSY)) are literally sharper than the silver ones. You can probably use any large brush, but I am very fond of the .75" Lineco bookbinding glue brushes.

## Prep
Glue gets everywhere, and it is important that it not get on the wrong parts of your book. Start by cutting at least 8 pieces of wax paper slightly larger than the text block. 

You will want to keep at least one edge square, so it will sit snugly against the spine of the book. I do this by cutting a large strip of wax paper and then cutting off book sized sections.

## Preparing the Textblock

1. Sand the spine with 80 or 120 to roughen the surface for gluing. You want to sand first so that you can be rough and not worry about damaging the pages.
2. Cut off most of the original cover, leaving a 2 inch strip, slightly inset from the top and bottom

>Often the first page is glued to the cover. You will need to either pull it off the glue so that the cover can be free, or gently score it along the seam and pull it out. Typically this page is not really part of the book, either being blank of with reviews, etc. If it is an essential page, you can always glue it back in, either as a leaf or as a made page.

## Endpapers

1. cut the endpapers to 2x the size of the textblock
2. fold in half
3. glue to textblock underneath the remaining cover, in a 3mm strip

>Grain: Grain should travel parallel to the spine. If you paper is labeled, then short/long grain means it is parallel to the short/long side of the paper. For unlabeled, cut a strip and wet one side. A strip cut along the grain will stay straight, but a strip cut across the grain will curl.

>Gluing: When gluing only a thin strip, you will want to cover everything but the strip you apply glue to with a waste sheet. That way you can still messily and quickly apply the glue but still get a perfect strip.

## Spine

Dimensions
L = L of textblock + 6mm (gives a 3mm border)
W = thickness of textblock + two board thicknesses (in our case, 5mm total)

1. Cut the spine first and then immediately glue the bands to it. I like to mark the spine, then put the glue, then lay the bands, then wipe the excess. 
2. You can move onto the covers while the spine dries
3. After the bands have dried, cut them at a slight angle

>Headbands: You can do any headband spacing you want. Most 1800s books I own have even spacing. However, I like to leave 3 spaces, for Title, Author, and Date. Recently I've done two at the top (20mm and 40mm) and three at the bottom (10mm, 25mm, and 55mm).

## Covers
We are going to cut everything once slightly oversized, tape it together and try it on the book, then get the final size.

Covers
W = W of textblock + 6mm - 12  mm (hinge gap) (might need to take this measurement from the textblock after taping)
L = L of textblock + 6mm

So, my text block was 140.5
I cut the cover to 140.5, then did a test fit. I thought it needed 3mm removed but I forgot to actually trim them. 

Spine
L = L of textblock + 6mm
W = thickness of textblock + one board thickness

Hinge Gap
Cut a hinge gap spacer
10 mm
/ /?.:h,'yu:/'?/:
Cut a turn in spacer
20 mm



Hinge gap = 12mm
reduce by 4.4mm 

Glue the leather bands to the spine


Glue on the head band
Glue on the spine cloth. it goes between the headbands


## The Case

Size
height = height of the text block + 2x the perimeter, where 3mm is a good size for the perimeter


cut a greyboard square. cut one side with a ruler, the from there use a square to cut the other sides. hold the ruler firmly and cut with multiple passes.
3mm edges around the book (assuming that it is a5 size)

gluing the leather
when cutting the leather, extend 1.5x the board thickness from the corner
you can make the diaganol cut and then pull out the leather

## Endpapers, Gluing the Spine, Trimming the Edges

The endpapers should be the same size as the text block. You can always cut them oversized and then trim them once they are glued on. 

Q: will I have the endpapers be inside of the original cover?
Q: how big do i make the gap, and how to i calculate it?

- cut a slightly oversized endpaper and fold it in half
- use a piece of parmament paper to protect the text block and glue a 1cm strip of the endpaper to the text block
- if you endpapers are not two sided, you might need to back them with another piece of paper before gluing them to the text block




Gluing shit

Had problems with accidently gluing the sides before i wanted to
had problems holding everything securely



## Casing In

[How to Measure the Corners](https://youtu.be/wApAv8IvGLU?si=kG6tHq-Gz13UCI3E&t=284)
watch from this time stamp. he makes it really easy.
watch the whole video, it is very good.
ffs he makes doing the paper so easy. the fold technique is perfect.

## Avoiding Warped Boards

[Avoiding Warped Boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWw6A7SObCo)

The side exposed to moisture will expand, and form the top of the curve.

Paper expands across the grain

- the thinner material should receive the adhesive, and the thinner material should be nearer the text block
   - if you put dry paper on a wet board, the thin paper will expand and wrinkle
   - when boards do warp, they should warp in towards the text block, not away from it. therefore the thin, pulling material should be closest to the text block
- PVA is a drier adhesive than paste, so it is less likely to warp the board
- DAS bookbinding doesn't criss cross the grain except when making springbacks

book cloth will stretch more in the grain direction.

## How to find grain direction
Long Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the long side of the paper.
Short Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the short side of the paper.

Grain should be head to tail, meaning parallel to the spine.

Bend it both ways. The way it bends easiest forms the axis that traces the grain direction.
Wet it on one side. A strip cut along the grain will stay straight, but a strip cut across the grain will curl.
You can cut a small slip of paper and wet it.

## Endpapers
[An Introduction to Endpapers for Bookbinding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUSkUiooDnQ)
- Not as practically informative as some other videos, but an interesting overview of the history and purpose of endpapers.

[Made Endpapers](https://youtu.be/4vN5xSY86iw?si=EI4Vi1TQfCsqTVQ8)
When using a single sided endpaper, you can back it with another piece of paper. You often do this by having two folded sheets (4 leafs) with the interior two glued together (3 final leafs). This can be done by fully gluing the interior pages, created a 'made page', or by gluing only the edge, created a 'flexible made page'
