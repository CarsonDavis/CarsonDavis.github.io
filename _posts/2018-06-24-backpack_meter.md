You should probably read this forum post for context: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/best-most-expensive-pocket-multimeter/.

I made a bunch of posts of varying quality on the EEVBlog and imgur back and 2018, and I am mostly just moving them over to this site so I don't lose them, as some of my imgur albums were deleted and the eevblog is pretty difficult to search.

It has a handle! Can you say that about your Sanwa PM300, Dave?

Nice storage solution for probes and other accessories!

You can even carry your EEVBlog meter as backup!
