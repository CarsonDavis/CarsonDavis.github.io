## Essential Materials
### Basics
The following materials are essential for developing film:
- chemicals:
  - developer
  - stop bath
  - fixer
  - hypo wash
- equipment:
  - film tank
  - film reel
  - dark bag
  - thermometer
  - alkali resistant gloves

### What I Use
I have very little experience using different chemicals or brands, and there may be better options available. However, I have been using the following chemicals for the past 5 years with good results:

#### [Arista Premium Film Developer](https://www.freestylephoto.com/6172-Arista-Premium-Liquid-Film-Developer-64-oz.-(Makes-5-Gallons))
- 64 oz bottle makes 5 gallons and costs $16
- 1+9 dilution
- [MSDS](https://www.freestylephoto.com/static/pdf/msds/aristapremium/ARISTA_PREMIUM_LIQUID_FILM_DEV_SDS.pdf)


Shelf Life:
- Unmixed: 2-3 years
- Mixed: 6 months to 1 year
- In use: You can reuse it, but I typically don't, since you have to modify the development time for each use

#### [Arista Premium Odorless Stop Bath](https://www.freestylephoto.com/6511-Arista-Premium-Odorless-Stop-Bath-16-oz.-(Makes-4-Gallons))

Basic Facts
- 16 oz bottle makes 4 gallons and costs $11
- 1+31 dilution
- Stop bath 15ml, water 485ml
- Stop bath 30ml, water 970ml
- You can save this, when it turns purple it's time to replace it

Shelf Life
- unmixed: up to 10 years
- mixed: several months
- in use: dozens of rolls of film, turns purple when exhausted
- [MSDS](https://www.freestylephoto.com/static/pdf/msds/aristapremium/ARISTA_PREMIUM_STOP_BATH_SDS.pdf)

Its longevity is primarily because itâ€™s used to neutralize the developer, which is an alkaline solution. Since the stop bath is acidic, it neutralizes the developer, and its effectiveness only diminishes as it becomes less acidic over time.


#### [Arista Premium Odorless Fixer](https://www.freestylephoto.com/6204-Arista-Premium-Odorless-Liquid-Fixer-64-oz.)

Basic Facts
- 64 oz bottle makes makes 2.5 gallons and costs $19
- 1+4 dilution
- Fixer 100ml, water 400ml
- Fixer 200ml, water 800ml
- [Tech Sheet](https://www.freestylephoto.com/static/pdf/product_pdf/aristapremium/ARISTA_PREMIUM_ODORLESS_FIXER_TECH_SHEET.pdf)
- [MSDS](https://www.freestylephoto.com/static/pdf/msds/aristapremium/Arista_Premium_Odorless_Fixer_SDS.pdf)


Shelf Life
- unmixed: 1-2 years
- mixed: 3-6 months
- in use: 20-30 rolls film
- You can use hypo check to see if it's exhausted. Will for form a white precipitate when it's exhausted.

#### [Arista Premium Hypo Wash](https://www.freestylephoto.com/6732-Arista-Premium-Hypo-Wash-32-oz.-(Makes-11-Gallons))
- 32 oz bottle makes 11 gallons and costs $19
- 1:43 dilution
- 12ml 488ml
- 25ml 975ml
- [MSDS](https://www.freestylephoto.com/static/pdf/msds/aristapremium/ARISTA_PREMIUM_ARCHIVAL_WASH_SDS.pdf)


## Steps
### Reusing Chemicals
If you are going to be developing several batches of film within a week, you can reuse the developer, stop bath, and fixer. As the developer wears out, you will need to increase the development times. The stop bath will turn purple when it is exhausted. 

If I know that I won't be developing any additional rolls for a while, then I will discard the chemicals after use.

### Roll the Film 


### Mixing the Chemicals
I develop in two main batches: 500ml and 1000ml depending on how many rolls of what kind I am developing. I use the following dilutions:


| **Chemical**   | **Ratio** | **500ml**   | **1000ml** |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Developer      | 1+9       | 50 + 450    | 100 + 900  |
| Stop Bath      | 1+31      | 15 + 485    | 32 + 968   |
| Fixer          | 1+4       | 100 + 400   | 200 + 800  |
| Hypo Wash      | 1+43      | 12 + 488    | 25 + 975   |

### Develop



Steps:
Ready the film

Mix the developer
fixer: use for 90 seconds (this is the max on the tech sheet)
