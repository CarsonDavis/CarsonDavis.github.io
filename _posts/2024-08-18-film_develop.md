Shelf Life (Unmixed): An unopened bottle of concentrated stop bath can last for several years (up to 10 years) if stored properly in a cool, dark place.
Shelf Life (Mixed): Once diluted, stop bath typically lasts for several months if kept in a sealed container and stored in a cool, dark place.
Usage Life: A working solution of stop bath can process dozens of rolls of film or prints before it needs to be replaced. Its longevity is primarily because itâ€™s used to neutralize the developer, which is an alkaline solution. Since the stop bath is acidic, it neutralizes the developer, and its effectiveness only diminishes as it becomes less acidic over time.

Shelf Life (Unmixed): If stored in a tightly sealed container away from light and heat, an unopened bottle of fixer concentrate can last for 1-2 years.
Shelf Life (Mixed): Once mixed with water, fixer solution typically lasts between 3-6 months if stored in a sealed container and kept away from extreme temperatures.
Usage Life: For typical use, a batch of mixed fixer can process about 20-30 rolls of 35mm film or an equivalent number of prints before it becomes exhausted.
