## The Pleasing Preceptor

This was my first old book, and it remains one of my favorites. In an era when scientific education was often dry and inaccessible, this charming volume by Gerhard Ulrich Anthony Vieth represents an early attempt to make natural history and physics engaging for young minds. Published almost 225 years ago in 1801, you can get a sense of the whole book just by reading it's delightful title...The Pleasing Preceptor; or Familiar Instructions in Natural History and Physics, Adapted to the Capacities of Youth, and Calculated Equally to Inform and Amuse Their Minds During the Intervals of More Dry and Severe Study; Taken Chiefly from the German of Gerhard Ulrich Anthony Vieth, Mathematical Teacher at Dessaw; Intended for the Use of Schools, and Illustrated with Cuts. Vol. II.

It has some wonderfully quaint scientific assertions, with my favorite being to "fixed air" and "dephlogisticated air" (what we now know as carbon dioxide and oxygen). There are also some fascinating discussions of spontaneous combustion cases, including some rather alarming accounts of people supposedly burning up from within! What's remarkable though is how much good science is contained within these pages. For a text from 1801, many of its explanations were quite advanced, and core principles like basic hydrostatics and specific gravity remain fundamentally accurate today. The author even shows admirable scientific skepticism at times, carefully questioning extraordinary claims - an approach that would fit right in with modern scientific thinking. Overall it is a genuinely delightful read.

The volume is bound in what seems to be an interesting variant on full tree calf, a popular binding style of the era that creates a distinctive marbled pattern on the leather. The first known tree calf bindings is from 1775, and they remained popular through the early 1800s. You can read a nice article about the technique [here](https://www.hewit.com/skin_deep/?volume=15&article=1#:~:text=Tree%20marbling%20was%20made%20popular,commissions%20up%20until%20the%201970s.).

## Natural History of the Human Species
Lt. Col. Charles Hamilton Smith (1776-1859) was a soldier, artist, and natural historian who exemplified both the scientific curiosity and the racial prejudices of his era. His works were notable for their detailed illustrations, as he was an accomplished artist who had provided drawings for several major natural history publications of the period.

This is a fascinating artifact of 19th-century scientific racism, with my copy being published in the same year as Darwin's Origin of Species. The work represents the culmination of pre-Darwinian thinking about human racial differences, complete with 34 colored plates that attempt to categorize humanity into distinct "types." While deeply problematic by modern standards, such works provide valuable insight into how Victorian science was used to construct and justify racial hierarchies.

The volume has an a partially removed bookplate of J. S. Sterrett. It features quarter-leather binding over marbled boards with matching marbled edges, a common but elegant binding style of the period. Despite some rubbing and wear to the covers, the binding remains sound and the pages clean, suggesting careful handling over its 160+ year history. It is a delightfully small and chonky book, maybe a little smaller than an old school mass market paperback, but with all the pomp of a fine binding.

## Paroissien Romain (Roman Missal)
This exquisite French prayer book from the late 19th century exemplifies the fine bookmaking traditions of the Mame publishing house in Tours. The volume is particularly noteworthy for its elaborate blind tooling on the covers and gilded page edges, showcasing the high level of craftsmanship typical of religious books from this period. The text is presented in both Latin and French, making it a practical devotional work for French Catholics of the era.

At one point in it's life, it had two clasps to hold it closed, but the female ends have been lost to time.

## Abrégé de l'Histoire Universelle
This charming early 19th-century French historical work by Count Ségur, member of the French Academy, represents a fascinating example of educational literature aimed at young readers. Published during the Bourbon Restoration period, it combines elegant half leather binding with beautifully marbled endsheets and edges. The title page suggests that the full work contained 150 engravings, but my particular volume 42 has only the title image. 

This is a true pocket sized book, fitting easily into the palm of my hand. It would be delightful to see all 42+ volumes together.

## Biographical and Critical Miscellanies
William H. Prescott (1796-1859) was one of America's most celebrated historians, renowned for his groundbreaking works on Spanish and Latin American history despite being nearly blind from a college accident. His meticulous research methods and engaging narrative style, developed while working with a special writing frame for the visually impaired, earned him international acclaim and helped establish American historical writing on the world stage. 

There are many, many printings of his works, but this is a particularly interesting and rare uncut copy from the limited Aztec Edition, which presents a fascinating glimpse into early 20th-century fine press publishing practices. As number 232 of only 250 copies produced, this volume is noteworthy for retaining its original unopened signatures - a remarkably well-preserved state that modern collectors prize. This means in the well over 100 years since it was printed, no one has ever read this particular book.

It has a gilt top edge while retaining uncut fore-edges and foot, and contains five illustrations including one in color. Of some bibliographic interest is its dual numbering as both Volume XX of the complete works and Volume I of the Miscellanies series.

## Tests of Metals: 1885
This fascinating government document offers an intriguing glimpse into both the technical and bureaucratic aspects of late 19th-century American military industrial development. The volume opens with what might be called an early example of government funding struggles - a remarkably candid letter to Congress pleading for additional resources, a rare personal touch in what is otherwise a technical document.

The book represents a year's worth of materials testing at the Watertown Arsenal, then a crucial facility for the U.S. military's quality control and research efforts. Of particular interest are detailed specifications for gun barrel manufacturing, highlighting the period's focus on standardization and quality control in weapons production. 

The volume has an interesting provenance, bearing an 1889 inscription from Col. Crooks to Mr. L. W. Rundlette, reinforcing the military overtones. Curiously, the report covers a fiscal year ending June 30th rather than October 30th, reflecting different government accounting practices of the era.

It's a massive tome, coming in at 1876g, or 4lbs 2oz.
