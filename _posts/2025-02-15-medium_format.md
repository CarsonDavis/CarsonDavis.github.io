Even the level of detail shown in the above scans does not compare with a drum scan, or even better, what a dedicated individual can achieve with stacked macro shots with a DSLR. Take a look at the difference between the scan produced at 6400 dpi by my V600 and the same area seen under a microscope.

Here, the microscope image closely resembles the quality you could expect out of a stacked macro. 

Now obviously your composition, subject, and lighting will always matter more than any amount of detail. 




## Yashica vs Pentax
When thinking about medium format, it's hard not to just think, big film = better photos. Or maybe you've heard of the "medium format look". But what does that mean?

Well, you need to be very careful. Foreground separation, bokeh, image compression...these things are certainly all impacted by the format, but the lens length and the aperture will probably have a bigger impact. 

In these shots, I am comparing my Yashica D with an 80mm 3.5 with my Pentax 67 with a 105mm 2.4. 

The Pentax has an edge here, both in the longer lens and the wider aperture. Which will produce noticeably more bokeh and a more compressed image with greater foreground separation.

I've done nothing special here in this photoshoot to illustrate the differences, I just happened to have both cameras out on the same day, but you can nonetheless see the large differences in the photos.

Take a loot at this overlay, where you can see how the blurrier background increases the eye's focus on the subject, even though the actual focus of the image is not perfectly sharp.

    <div class="caption">80mm f/3.5</div>

Notice how the three dimensional shape of the garden edging is compressed by the longer 105mm focal length.

However, if y take the right shot, even the yashica can produce very nice portraits.



Again, we see the massive difference in the standard blurry background photo shot.


So, we've seen all this, but does that make the Pentax a better camera? Well, frankly it is a better camera, but shooting wide open with blurry backgrounds is simply not always the best choice. Take a look at the photos in the dedicated Yashica D section below..
