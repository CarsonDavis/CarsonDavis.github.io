I'm not really a switch or keycap guru. There a plenty of people on the internet who have reviewed hundreds of switches and can give detailed feedback on every category. I've bought or used maybe only 10-15 different switches and therefore have a relatively limited knowledge on the subject. 

As I built my most recent keyboards, I did know that I wanted a lightweight, clicky switch, and that I also wanted to try out some tactile or silent tactile switches. 


# Key Caps
[NPKC Blank Thick PBT OEM Profile 61 ANSI Keycaps for MX Switches Mechanical Keyboard (Dark Gray)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WLMM1F5) - $18

[NPKC Blank Thick PBT OEM Profile 61 ANSI Keycaps for MX Switches Mechanical Keyboard (Light Blue)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XK984SB) - $18

These are what I currently use on my main keyboard.

[HyperX Memory Foam Wrist Rest - Mouse](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SGTWKWV) - $15

I bought 6 wrist rests in different price categories and from different materials, and this was by far the best. I now have one set at the office and one at home.
