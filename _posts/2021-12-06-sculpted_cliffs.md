In 2006, I was stranded on the side of a cliff when the tide came in. The story of how I hiked through the jungle to village is for another post, but in 2021 I was tasked with sculpting a childhood memory. As a researcher at the National Space Sciences and Technology Center, I get access to free classes, and during this semester I was taking sculpture and into to Japanese. 

While some of my more talented classmates made delightfully abstract representations of their childhood, I took a more direct approach, deciding that I wanted to craft a realistic representation of the cliff where I was stranded.

Sadly, I took almost no photos of the construction. So'll I'll need to give some text descriptions of the main components.

At this point in my life, I had never modeled anything, so the first thing I did was watch a ton of YouTube videos on modeling techniques. Even as a child of the internet era, it's still shocking to me just how perponderous the wealth of infomation online is. Although I watched many, these were the key videos I ended up relying on for techniques: 
- [general construction and ground cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GGT8-FIvCw)
- [trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNQTxX_jT4)
- [more trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLYEj3WREg)
- [painting the cliff](https://youtu.be/3SfP4RpcDYw?si=98uB0pgN6ZAyJ80c).

_order summary_

One of the goto websites for this stuff is WoodlandScenics. They have _everything_ related to models and dioramas. Above you can see the full order summary. It's possible I could have gotten by with fewer materials, but I only had one short weekend before the project was due, and I didn't want to take any chances.

If you click on the photo to enlarge it look to the right, you can see the wire tree before I added plaster. 
Materials arrived!
