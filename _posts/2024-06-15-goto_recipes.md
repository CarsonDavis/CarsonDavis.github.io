### Salad Greens
Salad greens to top a sandwich are almost always improved by a light sprinkle of vinegar and salt. The vinegar you use can be light and unobtrusive, like ume or apple cider, or it can be bold and flavorful, like black vinegar or balsamic.

# Ingredients
## Vinegars
- Ume Vinegar 
- [Kewpie Mayo](https://www.kewpieshop.com/products/kewpie-mayonnaise-asian). If you are used to standard American mayo like heinz, this will be a lifechanging upgrade. I spent several months in 2022 making all my mayo from scratch, but ultimately found kewpie to be an acceptable substitute to homemade, and a massive improvement over the standard american fare. If you buy this from the store, make absolutely certain you are not accidently purchasing the american formula. Get the original Japanese version which comes in a squeeze bottle inside of a plastic bag.
- Heinz Tomato Ketchup. It's ketchup. 
- Acetaia Bellei Sua Maestra Denso Dolce Antica Ricetta di Famiglia Balsamic Vinegar
- Cholua Chili Garlic
- Togo-Su Moromisu Moromi Vinegar
Naturally brewed rice vinegar aged in shoyu casks for 5 years. This is a light vinegar with an awesome, barrel aged flavor, similar to a whiskey.
- [Red Boat Fish Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Boat-Premium-Fish-Sauce/dp/B00B617XK2). This is an easy classic and widely recommended. Unlike some lesser offerings, it has no offensive fishy smell once mixed into a sauce or cooked.
- [CinSoy Small Batch Tamari](https://shop.findlaymarket.org/products/cinsoy-small-batch-tamari)
This is similar to soy sauce, but is less salty with a more complex umami flavor.
- [Yamaroku Shoyu Tsuru Bishio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TFXY0), Barrel aged 4 years
