## Kumar’s Buttered Chicken
Makes for four people.

- 1 tbsp chili powder (adjust to taste)
- ⅔ tbsp garam masala
- ½ tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp corn/rice starch
- 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Paprika for color
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Full-fat Greek yogurt (enough to coat the chicken)

#### Base
- 1 cup cashews (for soaking)
- Equal parts ghee and butter (enough to coat the bottom of a wok)
- 6 sticks of 3-inch cinnamon
- 14 cardamom pods
- 14 cloves
- 2 softball-sized onion, diced

- Heavy cream or half-and-half

#### Dessert:
- ½ pint half-and-half
- 10 saffron threads
- 1 cinnamon stick (fresh)
- 8-10 cardamom pods

### Chicken
#### Marinate
1. Soak cashews in water.
2. Cut chicken into slightly larger than bite-sized pieces.
3. In a bowl, combine the chicken with oil, chili powder, garam masala, cumin, corn/rice starch, ginger-garlic paste, salt, pepper, paprika, lemon juice, and Greek yogurt. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Marinate for at least 45 minutes.

#### Fry
1. Put the chicken on a pan and fry in the oven at 350 or 400 until they develop a crunchy exterior
2. Save the juices from the chicken for the base.

### Base
1. In a wok, melt equal parts ghee and butter over medium heat.
2. Add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves. Cook until they brown slightly, ensuring the butter does not burn.

## Roast Beef Sandwich
### The Fundamentals
- Publix Brioche Buns
- London Port Roast Beef
- Kewpie Mayo
- Cheese

### Variations
#### Plane Jane

- mayo, meat, munster. This has has that perfect nostalgic childhood feel, but with premium ingredients and techniques it shines beautifully.


#### Garlic Mayo
- mayo, meat, garlic, munster. Squeeze 1-2 cloves of garlic into the mayo and mix. If you nail the balance, this gives a robust punch that elevates the sandwich.

#### The Works
For those of you that love measurements, I recorded the exact amounts I used. I would caution you to use your own tastebuds to adjust.
- 80g beef
- 30g mayo + 3g garlic
- 15g arugula + 5g white vinegar + 5g dulce vinegar
- 10g microplaned Cabot Creamery Extra Sharp Cheddar

## Chocolate Mousse-Cheesecake

### Ingredients
- **8 oz chocolate**: I get the Baker’s brand bars that are 56% cacao. It is essential that you buy baking chocolate and not regular chocolate.
- **1 tablespoon shortening**: I get the Crisco bars, but I don’t think it matters.
- **6 oz cream cheese**: It needs to be softened before you can mix it.
- **¼ cup of butter**: Softened, not melted.
- **1/3 cup baking cocoa**: I get the powdered Hershey’s Cacao, natural Unsweetened.
- **1.5 cups of confectioners’ sugar**
- **2 tablespoons of milk**
- **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
- **2.5 cups whipping cream**
- **Raspberries or strawberries**

### Kitchenware
- **Cake pan**: I use one that is 9 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches deep. You should not use a pie pan, because the edges are a different angle.
- **Extra wide aluminum foil**: Regular aluminum foil is not wide enough to coat the bottom. It is ok if it is also “heavy duty”.
- **2 mixing bowls**: One for the chocolate mix and one for the whipped cream.
- **1 mixer**: If you don’t already have one, KitchenAid sells a reasonable $32 one at Target. It’s a very worthwhile upgrade over the $10 Walmart ones…
- **Measuring cup**: 2 cup capacity would be nice.
- **Measuring spoons**: You will need at least a tablespoon and a teaspoon.
- **Icing Dispenser**: I use a Ziploc bag and a plastic icing dispenser tip.

### Process
1. Soften the butter and cream cheese.
2. Line the cake pan with aluminum foil. AL foil should be smooth enough to not snag on the chocolate. See example picture.
3. Melt the chocolate and shortening in the microwave at 50%. I use 30-second intervals until it can be mixed with a spoon.
4. Let the chocolate sit until it is somewhat viscous, then pour the chocolate into the pan and swirl it around for the first time.
5. Put it in the fridge for 30 seconds or until it becomes more viscous. Then repeat the swirling, with the objective of strengthening the edges.
6. Put the chocolate shell back in the fridge. Leave for a minimum of 30 minutes.
7. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth.
8. Add cocoa, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix it in until smooth, but don’t go too crazy, because we are going to have to mix the whipping cream in too.
9. In a separate bowl, beat the whipping cream until it looks like whipped cream.
10. Add half the whipping cream to the other bowl, and mix with a spoon until it is all one color.
11. Remove the chocolate shell from the fridge. I pull the aluminum foil taut downwards around the shell, and this pulls the shell from out of the pan.
12. Pour/scoop chocolate mix into the shell. Smooth it relatively flat.
13. Squirt whipped cream around the edges and place fruit in a circle.
14. Refrigerate until eating.

## Mayo Marinade Chicken Tacos
This can be done in various levels of complexity. The recipe here is my more complicated take on Ethan's chicken [thighs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFX9gz-WMSw). He does just the mayo with the spices at the beginning and adds to an excellent sandwich with feta and pickled onions. He also has two more chicken recipes that are worth checking out, including an oven sheet recipe and a sweet potato chicken recipe.

### Ingredients
Initial Marinade
- 1 lb chicken thighs
- 3 tbs mayonnaise
- salt

Sauce Starter
- 2 tbs black vinegar
- 2 tbs Korean sweet sauce
- 2 tbs butter
- 2 tbs cane syrup

Spice Mix
- 2 ts garlic powder
- 2 ts red pepper
- 2 ts onion powder
- 2 ts oregano

Finisher
- 4 tbs cup sour cream or yogurt
- Tortillas


### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
    - Cut chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces.
    - In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with mayonnaise and salt

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
    - Heat a pan over medium-high heat
    - Add the chicken pieces to the pan and cook until browned on one side, then flip them over

3. **Glaze the Chicken:**
    - Add butter and cane syrup to the pan after flipping the chicken. Stir to coat the chicken
    - Continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, then remove from the pan and set aside on a cutting board

4. **Make the Reduction Sauce:**
    - In the same pan, add black vinegar and Korean sweet sauce
    - Add onion powder, Indian pepper flakes, and oregano to the pan
    - Stir constantly to prevent burning, cooking until the sauce thickens and forms a paste.

5. **Assemble the Tacos:**
    - Toast the tortillas in butter
    - Spread a thin layer of sour cream or yogurt down the middle of each tortilla
    - Cut the chicken into smaller pieces if necessary and pile them onto the tortillas
    - Drizzle the reduction sauce over the chicken, leaving some areas without sauce for flavor variation
    - You can optionally add microplaned cheese at this step

6. **Serve:**
    - Serve the tacos immediately, enjoying the blend of spicy, tangy, and creamy flavors.

### Detail Overload
So, the original recipe often burns a little if you want to make a reduction. I think it is the garlic/spice/oregano that is actually burning. It’s not a bad flavor if you want to make it this way, but it is very dark and intense bordering on burnt caramel.

So for an alternative, only coat the chicken in mayo and salt. You want a goodly amount of mayo, probably a couple tablespoons for 3 tacos worth of chicken. 

After cooking the first side and flipping the chicken, you can add some butter and cane syrup to the pan. Not a ton, just enough to kinda coat the bottom. This will glaze the chicken nicely, and you can take it out. I often cut the chicken in the pan with tongs to confirm it’s been cooked through. As soon as the raw color disappears, take it out and pile it on the cutting board while you finish up the sauce. Don’t cook it forever and ever -- it’ll cook any last little bit on the board.

Add black vinegar and korean syrup to the pan, enough to provide sauce for all the tacos. Then add a non-trivial amount of onion powder, indian pepper flakes, and oregano. I probably added half a tablespoon of each -- you want their flavor to come through. Then you cook the sauce. You’re trying to brown the butter/syrup right now, so you should see constant sticky bubbles forming and you want to stir constantly, being sure to clean the bottom as you stir, so nothing sticks and burns. Do this for a couple minutes. Don’t try to taste it, unless you’ve been meaning to rid yourself of those pesky taste buds.

Add sour cream or yogurt in a thin coating down the middle of each taco, not too heavy but enough to lighten it up. Cut the chicken on the board in big swoops to make it smaller than bite-sized and pile it on the tacos. Then pour a non-overwhelming amount of sauce on each taco. Leave some areas with no sauce; it’s nice to have some flavor variation bite to bite.
