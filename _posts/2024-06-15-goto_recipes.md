## Pantry Staples
### Sauce Components
#### Bases
- [Kewpie Mayo](https://www.kewpieshop.com/products/kewpie-mayonnaise-asian). If you are used to standard American mayo like Hellmann's, this will be a lifechanging upgrade. I spent several months in 2022 making all my mayo from scratch, but ultimately found kewpie to be an acceptable substitute to homemade, and a massive improvement over the standard american fare. If you buy this from the store, make absolutely certain you are not accidentally purchasing the American kewpie formula. Get the original Japanese version which comes in a squeeze bottle inside of a red and white
plastic bag.
- [Heinz Tomato Ketchup](https://www.amazon.com/Heinz-Tomato-Ketchup-32-Bottle/dp/B000WHXN3C). It's ketchup. I use it as a quick tomato base for many sauces, and you can do amazing things with it. Do not skimp out on some store brand crap.

#### Vinegars
- [Surasang Ume Plum Vinegar](https://www.ndmmarket.com/shop/grocery/salad_dressings_oil_vinegar/oil_vinegar/vinegars/surasang_ume_plum_vinegar/p/1564405684690159981). You use this similar to an apple cider vinegar: sweet and light acidity, perfect for elevating greens or adding a light touch to a sauce or mayonnaise. If you see the [Shih Chuan](https://www.amazon.com/21-12oz-Vinegar-Shih-Chuan-Taiwan/dp/B00CO461UI) version in your store, it is disgusting, don't bother.
- [Seggiano White Balsamic Vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Seggiano-Vinegar-Balsamic-White-Ounce/dp/B07FYD4ZS4). Light and sweet vinegar that goes amazing on toppings. You can use this similarly to the ume vinegar.
- [Togo-Su Moromisu Moromi Vinegar](https://waimports.com/product/moromisu-moromi-vinegar/). Naturally brewed rice vinegar aged in shoyu casks for 5 years. This is a light vinegar with an awesome, barrel aged flavor, similar to a whiskey.
- [Mizkan Pure Unpolished Brown Rice Vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Mizkan-Pure-Unpolished-brown-Vinegar/dp/B0017LJ0CU). A dark, rich flavor that goes great in sauces and on veggies.
- [Acetaia Bellei Sua Maestra Denso Dolce Antica Ricetta di Famiglia Balsamic Vinegar](https://www.bellei.it/en/products/denso-dolce-of-modena/sua-maesta-denso-dolce). Intense flavor and mild, 4% acidity. You can get this as low as $18 at Fresh market. This vinegar has forever changed how I view balsamic.


#### Enhancers
- [Red Boat Fish Sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Boat-Premium-Fish-Sauce/dp/B00B617XK2). This is an easy classic and widely recommended. Unlike some lesser offerings, it has no offensive fishy smell once mixed into a sauce or cooked.
- [CinSoy Small Batch Tamari](https://shop.findlaymarket.org/products/cinsoy-small-batch-tamari)
This is similar to soy sauce, but is less salty with a more complex umami flavor.
- [Yamaroku Shoyu Tsuru Bishio](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TFXY0). Soy sauce that has been barrel aged 4 years, this is a seriously expensive Japanese soy sauce that has a richer and less puckering flavor that the standard Kikkoman. It's only worth it if you are using it straight on a dish, since once you start cooking with it or mixing it into a sauce the flavor will be lost.
- [Beksul Korean Plum Extract](https://megakfood.com/products/8801007343884). Put this in sauces to add sweetness and plum flavor. 
- [Cholua Chili Garlic](https://www.amazon.com/Cholula-Chili-Garlic-Sauce-Ounce/dp/B07M882H5H). I love this for adding umami and heat to a sauce.
- [Hamchorom Perilla Oil](https://megakfood.com/products/8809058821573). A more subtle sesame oil. When making sauces with sesame, I often overdo it and the flavor becomes overpowering. This is a good alternative that gives you more leeway in your concoctions.

## Grains
- [Nishiki Medium Grain Rice](https://www.amazon.com/Nishiki-Medium-Grain-Rice-Pound/dp/B00852ZN2U). Great all purpose rice for fried rice, bibimbap, or as a side.
- [Publix Brioche Hamburger Buns](https://www.publix.com/pd/brioche-hamburger-buns-4ct/RIO-BBR-596690). These come from the publix bakery and are the shit.
- [King Arthur All-Purpose Flour](https://www.amazon.com/KING-ARTHUR-FLOUR-PURPOSE-PACK/dp/B07G8KVWJP). This stuff is great; I keep a container of it at all times.
- [King Arthur All-Purpose Bread Flour](https://www.amazon.com/King-Arthur-Organic-Bread-Flour/dp/B008230RN2). Perfect for bread...
- [Panko](https://www.amazon.com/Plain-Bread-Crumbs-oz-Pack/dp/B075THZNWY). I haven't honestly been able to tell a meaningful difference between the various brands of panko I've bought. Lately, I've been using 4C. This stuff is amazing for breading and frying.

## Seasonings
- [Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt](https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Crystal-Kosher-Salt-Additives/dp/B0BQPXDF8X). This is the gold standard salt for cooking. It's perfect for hand seasoning and has slowly become the standard used in modern baking recipes.
- [Maldon Sea Salt Flakes](https://www.amazon.com/Maldon-Sea-Salt-Flakes-ounce/dp/B00017028M). These fragile pyramids of delicate, melt-in-your mouth salt are worth every penny, and will elevate cookies, meat, veggies, you name it. You do not use these while cooking, they are added immediately before serving.

## Techniques
### How to Toast Bread
Butter. Lots of butter. 

First, butter tastes amazing. Second, the liberal use of butter ensures that there will be even heating across the bread. If you use, say, a half  to a full tablespoon of butter across two buns, they should become fully moist across the entire bottom of each bun. Then, as you gently toast them, they will become a perfect golden brown. Once on the sandwich, they will have a rich flavor and a satisfying crunch. When done correctly, this will not be the dry, hard crunch of bread left in the toaster too long, but a firm crystalline crunch that gives way to a soft, moist interior. Many people add lettuce to the tops of their sandwiches to add a crunch, but if you toast the bread correctly, you will not need this.

### Sandwich Toppings
#### Salad Greens
Salad greens to top a sandwich are almost always improved by a light sprinkle of vinegar and salt. The vinegar you use can be light and unobtrusive, like ume or apple cider, or it can be bold and flavorful, like black vinegar or balsamic.

#### Raw Onions
As will salad greens, raw onions can be immeasurably improved by letting them soak in a light vinegar with salt. Lemon or lime juice can also be used, and on the right sandwich you can microwave the onions to speed the process.

#### Tomatoes
A good tomato will impart a rich flavor and pleasing texture. But a bad tomato will flood your sandwich with water. I always cut my tomatoes ahead of time and lay them out on a cutting board and then gently salt them. This highlights the flavor and gets rid of excess water.

### Caramelized Onions
Caramelizing onions is not fast. You should expect even a light caramelization to take 15 minutes, while a thorough job can take in excess of 30. For my purposes, I almost always am trying to balance speed with results, and will make some compromises to get a meal on the table in a reasonable time. Therefore I often use a high heat and a lot of butter to get a good result in 10-15 minutes. 

The first key to success is consistent onion size. Failing to chop uniformly will result in the smaller and thinner pieces burning and ruining the taste. Therefor the first step is to be as deliberate as possible with the initial cutting. It should be noted that the smaller you cut the onion pieces, the faster you will achieve results, but the higher the likelihood that you will burn and ruin the dish.

Second you should use the best non-stick pan you own. Any sticking will result in burnt onions. 

Thirdly, under no circumstances should you skip on your oil of choice. For best taste, I tend to use butter, and a lot of it. The oil will transfer the heat evenly instead of allowing it to concentrate on hot spots on the surface of each individual onion piece, and the more oil you use, the easier time you will have achieving a good result. For reference, I might use 3 tablespoons or more for a single large onion. You can alway dry off any excess oil with a paper towel at the end.

As you cook the onions, you will have to stir more and more frequently as time goes on. In the beginning, when the onions still contain a lot of water, you will need to stir only occasionally. But by the end, you will be stirring almost constantly.

There are some key signs to look for while stirring. In the beginning, you will be looking for the size and speed of bubbles around the onions. As water leaves the onions and the side of the onion touching the pan dries out, the bubbles will become smaller and more frequent. As soon as you see any indication of this, you should stir the onions and flip them over so that a new side touches the pan. 

As browning begins to occur, you will begin seeing a small color change each time you flip the onions. I'll need to think more on this next comment, but there is a way to tell mid cooking whether the onions are too dry and need more oil. 

In the early stages of browning, you should be looking for any smaller or thinner pieces that are browning obviously more rapidly than the rest. These pieces will burn and ruin the dish if left unchecked. You should remove them as soon as you see them. It's better to get them at the early stages of browning than to wait until they are blackened, as by this point in the cooking the stirring will have become more frantic and you will have less time to spare. 

Often I will start on my particular stove at 8/10 heat, and then reduce to 6/10 heat as the onions begin to brown.
