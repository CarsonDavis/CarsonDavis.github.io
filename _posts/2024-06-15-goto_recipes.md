- Salt and pepper to taste
- Paprika for color
- Juice of ½ lemon
- Full-fat Greek yogurt (enough to coat the chicken)

#### Base

- 14 cardamom pods
- 14 cloves
- 2 softball-sized onion, diced
- Juice from marinated chicken

- Spices: chili powder, black pepper, turmeric, garam masala (carefully), salt
- Heavy cream or half-and-half

#### Dessert:

### Chicken
#### Marinate
1. Soak cashews in water.
2. Cut chicken into slightly larger than bite-sized pieces.
3. In a bowl, combine the chicken with oil, chili powder, garam masala, cumin, corn/rice starch, ginger-garlic paste, salt, pepper, paprika, lemon juice, and Greek yogurt. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Marinate for at least 45 minutes.

#### Fry
1. Put the chicken on a pan and fry in the oven at 350 or 400 until they develop a crunchy exterior
2. Save the juices from the chicken for the base.

### Base
1. In a wok, melt equal parts ghee and butter over medium heat.
2. Add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves. Cook until they brown slightly, ensuring the butter does not burn.
3. Add diced onions and the juice from the marinated chicken. Cook until the onions no longer smell raw.
4. Add ground ginger-garlic paste to the onions and cook for a few minutes.
5. Add diced tomatoes and cook until they lose their shape.
6. Season with chili powder, black pepper, turmeric, garam masala, and salt.
7. Grind the mixture into the smoothest paste possible, sieving if necessary for a smoother texture.
8. Return the paste to the wok, add heavy cream or half-and-half, and cook for 10-20 minutes until the desired consistency is reached.
9. Add the fried chicken pieces and chicken oil and cook for an additional 5 minutes.

### Dessert:
1. In a small pot, heat half-and-half with saffron threads, a fresh cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods over medium-low heat.
2. Simmer until thickened, then serve with bread.
