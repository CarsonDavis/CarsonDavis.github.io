## Techniques
### How to Toast Bread
Butter. Lots of butter. 

First, butter tastes amazing. Second, the liberal use of butter ensures that there will be even heating across the bread. If you use, say, a half  to a full tablespoon of butter across two buns, they should become fully moist across the entire bottom of each bun. Then, as you gently toast them, they will become a perfect golden brown. Once on the sandwich, they will have a rich flavor and a satisfying crunch. When done correctly, this will not be the dry, hard crunch of bread left in the toaster too long, but a firm crystalline crunch that gives way to a soft, moist interior. Many people add lettuce to the tops of their sandwiches to add a crunch, but if you toast the bread correctly, you will not need this.

### Sandwich Toppings
#### Salad Greens
Salad greens to top a sandwich are almost always improved by a light sprinkle of vinegar and salt. The vinegar you use can be light and unobtrusive, like ume or apple cider, or it can be bold and flavorful, like black vinegar or balsamic.

#### Raw Onions
As will salad greens, raw onions can be immeasurably improved by letting them soak in a light vinegar with salt. Lemon or lime juice can also be used, and on the right sandwich you can microwave the onions to speed the process.

#### Tomatoes
A good tomato will impart a rich flavor and pleasing texture. But a bad tomato will flood your sandwich with water. I always cut my tomatoes ahead of time and lay them out on a cutting board and then gently salt them. This highlights the flavor and gets rid of excess water.

### Caramelized Onions
Caramelizing onions is not fast. You should expect even a light caramelization to take 15 minutes, while a thorough job can take in excess of 30. For my purposes, I almost always am trying to balance speed with results, and will make some compromises to get a meal on the table in a reasonable time. Therefore I often use a high heat and a lot of butter to get a good result in 10-15 minutes. 

The first key to success is consistent onion size. Failing to chop uniformly will result in the smaller and thinner pieces burning and ruining the taste. Therefor the first step is to be as deliberate as possible with the initial cutting. It should be noted that the smaller you cut the onion pieces, the faster you will achieve results, but the higher the likelihood that you will burn and ruin the dish.

Second you should use the best non-stick pan you own. Any sticking will result in burnt onions. 

Thirdly, under no circumstances should you skip on your oil of choice. For best taste, I tend to use butter, and a lot of it. The oil will transfer the heat evenly instead of allowing it to concentrate on hot spots on the surface of each individual onion piece, and the more oil you use, the easier time you will have achieving a good result. For reference, I might use 3 tablespoons or more for a single large onion. You can alway dry off any excess oil with a paper towel at the end.

As you cook the onions, you will have to stir more and more frequently as time goes on. In the beginning, when the onions still contain a lot of water, you will need to stir only occasionally. But by the end, you will be stirring almost constantly.

There are some key signs to look for while stirring. In the beginning, you will be looking for the size and speed of bubbles around the onions. As water leaves the onions and the side of the onion touching the pan dries out, the bubbles will become smaller and more frequent. As soon as you see any indication of this, you should stir the onions and flip them over so that a new side touches the pan. 

As browning begins to occur, you will begin seeing a small color change each time you flip the onions. I'll need to think more on this next comment, but there is a way to tell mid cooking whether the onions are too dry and need more oil. 

In the early stages of browning, you should be looking for any smaller or thinner pieces that are browning obviously more rapidly than the rest. These pieces will burn and ruin the dish if left unchecked. You should remove them as soon as you see them. It's better to get them at the early stages of browning than to wait until they are blackened, as by this point in the cooking the stirring will have become more frantic and you will have less time to spare. 

Often I will start on my particular stove at 8/10 heat, and then reduce to 6/10 heat as the onions begin to brown.
