If you've been keeping up to date with this blog, then you'll know that I'm a [pretty serious about my knives]({% link _posts/2023-12-22-babys_first_cleaver.md %}). You may even suspect that I have my fair share of kitchen knifes.

I think this is about half of them. 

But let's start at the beginning. In college, I didn't know any better, and I had some very mediocre ceramic knives. They were supposed to never need sharpening but the sad truth was that they were never all that sharp to begin with.

When I finally graduated and got my own place, I knew what was up. I went to a local gun and knife show and met a local guy who forged hand made chef knives out of Birmingham damascus steel. Please take a moment to bask in its beauty.

Yea, turns out it's a piece of literal garbage. Just because it is local, hand made, and damascus does not mean it will cut well.

This would have been around 2016, and the whole camping/wilderness community had this unreasonable penchant for thick full tang blades that could weather a nuclear winter and be used afterwards to quarry enough iron to rebuild civilization. What they apparently did <i>not</i> care about, was how well the knives cut. This rubbed off onto me, hence this absolute monster of a chef knife.

Let me explain. There are only a couple things that actually matter about a knife. The shape of the knife and the profile of the blade. The steel used, the handle material, how pretty it is...that stuff matters a little, but if you want a knife that will glide through an onion like a shark through a public beach, then you should be looking at shape and profile.

![signal-2024-05-19-165002_002](signal-2024-05-19-165002_002.jpeg)

This is called a choil shot, and it shows the cross-sectional geometry of the blade at the, you guessed it, choil. Examining a knife from this angle will be the single largest indicator of how well it will perform. There are a few specifics that affect food release, handling, etc, but the purposes of this demo, let me clarify that thinner is almost always better. 

You could literally rub the edge of that knife on the left across a brick and it would still cut onions better than when that damascus monstrosity is sharp enough to shave.

Anyway, I think I used that knife-shaped paper weight exactly one time before realizing the horrible mistake I had made and put it in the drawer of shame. 

That's when my dad stepped in and gave me my first actually good cooking tool, a Shun 8in chef knife. Now, a lot of knife people on the internet like to hate on Shun, presumably because soccer moms can buy them in Home Goods instead of needing to hike into the Japanese wilderness to offer their first born child to a 100 year old bladesmith, but frankly they are perfectly good knives.

They are easy to care for, have reasonably thin geometries, and they come in familiar profiles, such as the western chef knife shown here. The only real downsides are that they are on the expensive side and that their VG-10 MAX formulation easily microchips when compared with other manufacturers VG-10. 

That 8in Shun will set you back $170, but I have a literal drawer full of handmade Japanese knives that cost less. Know that if you are in the market for a knife in the $75-$175 price range, there are a LOT of other options you should consider. But if you already own a Shun, know that they take wicked edge and that I still happily use both of mine when the mood strikes me.

In the summer of 2020, I began to look longingly at a the exotic Japanese blade style called the Nakiri. It's short and square, and designed specifically for cutting vegetables. 

I settled on the maker Miyabi, which is like a high-class Shun. They're made of SG2 (a better steel) and feature an overall better fit and finish, with nicer design choices and many of the final steps done by hand.

This is a wonderful knife that got me started on Japanese blade profiles, and an upcoming birthday quickly gave me a chance to round out my collection with a utility knife and bread knife. (thanks mom and little sis!)

Let me take a moment to say that I fucking <i>love</i> having a good bread knife. They get no credit in the knife corners of the internet, and I simply do not understand why. To be fair, I don't actually use mine for bread -- my normal knives are plenty sharp for this -- but there are absolutely tasks where sawing with serrations is the best approach. For example, when cutting a chilled steak lengthwise to get two thinner steaks.


![LRM_EXPORT_1686150517891832_20221115_085254983](LRM_EXPORT_1686150517891832_20221115_085254983.jpeg)

But I was not long for the world of stainless. Like all knife people, The knife subreddit whispered to me in the night of the dark steel that was too hard for normal people to take care of. The mystical material used by the ancients. Sharper, harder, purer, and somehow less expensive. Carbon steel. 

In the cold winter of 2020 I bought three Tojiro Shirogami blades in rapid succession. A nakiri, kiritsuke, and yanagiba. These are on the budget end of Japanese knives, costing only $60, $100, and $144 respectively. You've already met the nakiri style, but a kiritsuke is 9.5in executive chef knife and a yanagiba is a whopping 12 inch sushi knife. In retrospect, I basically never use these styles, but they look cool as shit on my knife magnet.

If you consider buying a Tojiro in Shirogami, remember that they are budget minded, and occasionally have quality problems. All of mine were fine, but you still need to do sanding on the choil, and the handles they come with are less than awesome. 

The four gorgeous handles you see are aftermarket stabilized burl maple, and I bought them from sharpedgeshop and installed them myself, a process which can be difficult if you do it wrong. I'll add a post on this soon.

I lasted almost an entire year before discovering my new passion: chinese vegetable cleavers, or cai doas. It was around this time that I started getting serious about cooking, and as you can see, I really, <i>really</i> liked taking pictures of the veggies I cut. I think I was half proud of the knife, and half proud that I had finally learned what a vegetable was.

This particular knife is the Chan Chi Kee KF1302 Cai Dao in 219mm. Take notes, because it remains one of my favorite knives to use. They come in a smaller variant as well as stainless variants, but don't bother, the 1302 is perfection. It's as thin as a Shibata, easy to handle as a bunka, can double as a food scoop, and only costs $75. I <i>love</i> this knife.

![signal-2024-05-19-165557_002](signal-2024-05-19-165557_002.jpeg)
But oh, dear reader...I wanted more. Surely the very first cai doa I purchased wouldn't be the best on the market? Surely there was something with a nicer steel, a more premium handle, a thinner blade? 

Twenty cleavers later, I can assure you there was not. Oh, sure there's some nice stuff out there. If you are willing to sacrifice some blade thickness for a more premium steel and nicer fit and finish, or if you like rock chopping, I'd recommend the very affordable Chopper King White #2 Cleaver. And if you want to crush some cow bones, I might point you towards my trusty F-Dick No84, 8x53. 

People on the internet will sing the praises of the Sugimotos, Migotos, or Gesshins, but I've seen the choil shots and done a [comprehensive mass analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IfRf8wQMZD4Cd0bC3cuiMN6z-7NmGrMTgxKAvLZW_Kg) and as far as I know, there is nothing short of the unobtainable Takeda that is even in the ballpark of the laser-like profile of my CCK 1302.

![signal-2024-05-19-154722_008](signal-2024-05-19-154722_008.jpeg)

It's appropriate at this point draw your attention to the massive variation in cleaver profiles. Unlike in the earlier example, I'm not disparaging the right two cleavers, which are for bones not vegetables. The gracile beauty on the left is obviously my 1302, which would break in half if you used it on a bone. But the Daways in the middle is perfect for chicken bones while being passable on veggies, and the rustic chinatown find on the right was marketed for fish but will also do well on everything up to chicken.


![signal-2024-05-19-154722_007](signal-2024-05-19-171659_002.jpeg)
But lets back up. Long before I had 20 cleavers, within days of buying my 1302, I also rounded out my specialty knives collection.

We've seen the middle yanagiba before, but allow me to introduce the Tojiro Molybdenum Vanadium Steel Soba Kiri in 240mm and the Tojiro Shirogami #2 Usuba in 165mm. These are both highly specialized Japanese knives, one for making soba and the other for carving vegetable art. They are both very neat knives, and my only regret is not spending the extra money to buy the soba knife in 300mm.

You can see me using both knifes for their intended purpose above. And it's probably a good time to mention that you can click on the images to enlarge them.

Up til now I had been buying reasonably priced knives that had seen the inside of a factory at some point in their lives. But I was starting to believe those knife snobs that hated on Shun. The forums were whispering to me of lonely blacksmiths, hammering iron in the hidden depths of the Japanese mountains. 

Which is how I spent $300 on a Shibata Koutetsu R2 Migaki Gyuto in 210mm. The gyuto is every snob's favorite knife, and if you want a true laser, there are only a handful of choices. I considered some others, but they were all in this price range, and I loved the aggressive tip on the Koutetsu, so when one came in stock I grabbed it.

The cherry sheath it is wearing was handmade by yours truly (more on that later), but the rest is original. At this price point, the knives you get are perfect and need no extra finishing or replacement handles. 

This knife is an absolute dream. If you have the budget for it, do not hesitate. Everyone online likes to casually throw around the word 'laser' when describing how knives cut, but seriously, it glides through food like a god damn light saber. It's a tough race, but in some foods I feel like it even out performs my 1302.

How do I actually store all of them...?

Looking at this picture, you may be wondering, do I have enough cleavers?

No. Don't be ridiculous. You can never have too many cleavers.
