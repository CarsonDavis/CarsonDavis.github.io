## Overview

In early 2020, there was a brief period where the whole world had shut down, no one knew exactly what the dangers were, and there was absolutely not enough protective equipment for nurses, doctors, and other frontline workers.

Destin Sandlin, from the science and engineering channel SmarterEveryDay, put out a call for help, and I quickly got involved in the project. I worked on logistics, communications, web design, and actual 3d printing. 

Ultimately, we were able to make and deliver over 40,000 face shields to frontline workers all across Alabama and the surrounding states before ultimately transitioning to injection molding, a process that made 5,000 shields every day.

## Video Interview

At the time, I was interviewed by a local news station about the project. Here is the video:
