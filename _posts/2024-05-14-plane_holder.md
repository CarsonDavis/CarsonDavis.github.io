description: Making a hanging storage solution for my hand planes.
---
To put it simply, I have a ton of hand planes. And they are taking up my whole damn workbench.

I've seen a bunch of YouTube videos where people have their planes hanging on the wall, and not only does it look sick, it also looks easy to build.

Here's the current collection. Soon I'll add a post going through each plane, their uses and history.

Here I'm testing out a possible layout. I've got 1/4 inch birch and two thicknesses of oak. Thicker for the borders and thinner for the dividers. You can see that I originally wanted to include my block plane, but it's geometry makes it very difficult to retain.

So, once they are hanging on the wall, how do we keep them from falling off? The trick is to use the front of the plane. This will be easy with the metal plane, since it has a long expanse where Bailey is written, but the wooden plane has only a small ledge. For this, we will need to use the sides.

Making these circular cutouts can sometimes be difficult. Here, I used double sided tape to stick the oak to a 2x4, punched a starter hole in the 2x4, and then drilled it out carefully on the drill press. I later tunes it up with a half round file.

For the wooden plane cutout, I started with a Japanese pull saw, then a coping saw, and finally finished up with a file. For small jobs like this, I don't usually bother getting out my scrollsaw.

So we are getting closer to the final product. I didn't picture it, but I've also cut spacers for each plane. I did this by quickly taking a caliper reading of the plane width, adding 6mm, and marking a piece of oak with the caliper tips. I like this process a lot, as it is very accurate and repeatable, and you can just slot the tooth of the chop saw into the mark and cut.

At this point, I've chopped everything to length. A couple months ago, I finally got around to making a stop system for my miter saw. I'll add a post about it soon. But anyway, when you want to make repeated cuts like the dividers, you set a stop on the miter saw and just keep cutting. It's significantly faster and more accurate than measuring each time. To cut the plywood, I didn't even measure, I just used the dividers in between the fence and the blade to get a length.

You can see here how I made some light pencil marks to guide me during the glue up.

This picture looks pretty far along, but I'm only actually gluing the border. The interior pieces are just sitting to makes sure they will fit.

After gluing the borders, I went through and carefully did each divider and stop. For the ones in the middle, I had to lay a long board with a spacer across and clamp on the ends. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of this process. Ultimately, I had to do 3 separate glue ups over the course of a couple days.

And here's the final result! It's actually still not finished, as I need to sand it, oil it, and then hang it on the wall. But I'll need to save that for another weekend... I also haven't quite figured out how to hang it.
