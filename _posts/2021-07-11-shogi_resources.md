## Overview
This post collects a variety of resources for learning and playing shogi. It is by no means exhaustive, but it includes the main resources I have personally found useful.

## Learning
- [Knowledge Share](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DyVI2AhRVRZL-5HEwd_T4rhr4eVUxzqTZ3qwWRviaFE/edit?usp=sharing): A brief knowledge share I made on shogi. It leaves out some details, since it was meant to be a visual aide, but it still has some nice, quick info.
- [Lishogi Learn](https://lishogi.org/learn): Excellent website for teaching, puzzles, and playing shogi against a computer. Doesn't have a huge player base, but the interface is wonderful. If you do the the entire [learn section](https://lishogi.org/learn), you'll be more than ready for some fun games. There is also a [resources section](https://lishogi.org/resources) which has many additional great links.
- [Lily's Static Rook Basics](https://lishogi.org/study/2C1urJSL/abUHiyH9): Great guide on the static rook playstyle put together by Lily, the first person I ever played.
- [Killer Ducky's Study Plan](https://killerducky.github.io/shogi/study_plan): 
- [Hidetchi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0NjuaCHCtMt19y8U_eoO1g): Makes excellent tutorials on YouTube. This guy is the OG.
- [Shogi Terminology](http://www.shogi.net/shogivocab/vocabhtml.html): Amazing collection of hundreds shogi terms.
- [Takodori Joseki](https://www.reddit.com/r/shogi/comments/aiqtx2/takodoris_book_line_posts_collected/): Huge collection of digitized joseki. It might be a fun project to convert all of these into a lishogi study.

## Supplies
- [Shogi CZ](https://shogi.cz/en/): My number one recommendation for beginner friendly boards and [pieces](https://shogi.cz/en/shop/white-box-japanese-chess-game-pieces-kanji-arrows/).
- [Tengudo](https://go.tengudo.jp/en/): The online storefront of a shogi and go store in Kyoto, they have a wide and often affordable selectinon of go and shogi gear, including [miniature boards](https://go.tengudo.jp/en/shogi-set/1968.html), [affordable carved sets](https://go.tengudo.jp/en/shogi-piece/2395.html), and more. 
- [Kurokigoishiten](https://kurokigoishiten.com/en/collections/%E5%B0%86%E6%A3%8B): Sells a large assortment of premium shogi and go gear.
- [Neko Mado](http://shop.nekomado.com/): Shogi books, [blank pieces](http://shop.nekomado.com/products/detail.php?product_id=46), variants like [kyoto shogi](http://shop.nekomado.com/products/detail.php?product_id=165), and [several](http://shop.nekomado.com/products/detail.php?product_id=14) high quality [beginner's sets](http://shop.nekomado.com/products/detail.php?product_id=22).

## Playing
- [Lishogi](https://lishogi.org/): Excellent website for teaching, puzzles, and playing shogi against a computer. Doesn't have a huge player base, but the interface is wonderful. If you do the the entire [learn section](https://lishogi.org/learn), you'll be more than ready for some fun games.
- [81 Dojo](https://81dojo.com/en/): Incredibly antiquated, but this is where all the players are.
