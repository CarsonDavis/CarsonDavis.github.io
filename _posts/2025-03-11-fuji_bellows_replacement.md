- Remove the batteries

open the back and unscrew the four main screws around the lens

you can now close the back, open the front, and push off the bellows from the lens

put the lens at infinity focus and tape in in place. push the tape down into the grooves

use pin pliers to unscrew the bolts. DO NOT LOSE THE LITTLE WASHER

now you must wind the film and slightly close the bellow so you can unscrew the two hidden screws that will be revealed from underneath the arms

now the worst part. for some insane reason, the bellows are attached from the inside
