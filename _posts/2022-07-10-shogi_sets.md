This is the absolute best set on the market for beginners or for teaching shogi. The directional arrows are perfect for learning the rules, the font used for the kanji is clear and readable, and the quality is excellent for the price. The markings are not only colored, but also stamped into the wooden pieces, so I expect them to never wear off. Mine are still holding up great a year after my purchase. They've even considered the smallest details, such as writing on the promoted side the symbol of the piece which was promoted.

I've included pictures of the full set, detailed close ups, and a comparison with a traditional hand-carved set. Please note that this set does not include a board, you will need to buy that separately. The company that makes these pieces also sells a board, which is what I have pictured.
