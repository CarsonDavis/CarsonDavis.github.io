## Overview
In the summer of 2021, I was deeply obsessed with shogi. I spent hours every day playing and studying. Even though everyone I played with was online, eventually I got it into my head that I wanted a physical shogi set.

Shogi sets are differentiated by material, construction, and font.

### Material
There are really only two commonly used materials: plastic and wood. Shogi is an old-school, traditional game, and no self respecting player would use anything except wood. However within the category of wood there is basic common wood from unknown trees, and then there is expensive, tight-grained hardwood used in the most expensive sets, which can cost thousands of dollars.

### Construction
After the base material, there are various options for how the letters are applied to the pieces.
- **Printed:** The cheapest is to simply print the letters on the wood or plastic in a factory. 
- **Stamped:** Slightly better is to stamp the letters into the wood and paint over the stamp.
- **Painted:** Not as durable as stamping, but a more premium option is to have a craftsman hand paint paint the letters.
- **Carved:** A large step up in quality is to have the letters carved into the wood.
- **Laquered:** Carved letters can be filled with laquer to make them more durable. This is by far the most expensive option, as laquer is added layer by layer in a process that can take weeks. 

### Font
Where chess can have interesting designs for the exact shape of the pieces, shogi has a large variety in fonts. If you want to read a little more in depth, I stumbled across [this site](https://en.i-tsu-tsu.co.jp/blog/shogi/948) which covers 9 different fonts.

    </div>
    <div class="caption">
        <em>Ryoko (菱湖) by 山上</em>
    </div>
</div>

I don't know if this is a hard rule, but I've noticed that many laquered and painted sets use a bold and fast font similar to the first image, which is an affordable set from Kurokigoishiten. The second image shows what is probably the most popular competition font, Kinki. The third image is my personal set (and personal favorite) Ryōko, which was popularized by calligrapher Maki Ryōko (1777-1843). To my eye, it manages to be elegant and flowing and aggressive all at once, and I adore it.

There are some excessively gorgeous sets out there, such as this $3,325 mori-age set by modern master Fugetsu, carved in Satsuma-hon-tsuge Himawari-moku wood in the Minase script.


## Shogi Pieces
So you want to buy a physical shogi set. 

There aren't really a ton of good options in the American market. Unlike with chess or go, I would recommend avoiding the sets on Amazon. They are either low quality, overpriced, or have hideous fonts. If you simply must buy on amazon, I would recommend the [Koma Shogi Set](https://www.amazon.com/Shogi-Japanese-Chess-Wooden-Pieces/dp/B07BB59942) over the [Yellow Mountain Imports set](https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Wooden-Drawers-Traditional-Pieces/dp/B003UKEMSS).


## Beginner Set
June 9, 2021
Shogi Cz makes by far the [best beginner set](https://shogi.cz/en/shop/white-box-japanese-chess-game-pieces-kanji-arrows/) on the market.

This is the absolute best set on the market for beginners or for teaching shogi. The directional arrows are perfect for learning the rules, the font used for the kanji is clear and readable, and the quality is excellent for the price. The markings are not only colored, but also stamped into the wooden pieces, so I expect them to never wear off. Mine are still holding up great a year after my purchase. They've even considered the smallest details, such as writing on the promoted side the symbol of the piece which was promoted.

I've included pictures of the full set, detailed close ups, and a comparison with a traditional hand-carved set. Please note that this set does not include a board, you will need to buy that separately. The company that makes these pieces also sells a board, which is what I have pictured.
