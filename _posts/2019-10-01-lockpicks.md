What picks are you using? Have you tested the width on you exterior pins? I was struggling to pick dimples with my Black Flags. Then the Multipicks arrived and I suddenly felt like BosnianBill.

Mine was a gift, although if I lost it I would buy another without hesitation. I have the biggest set, the Multipick ELITE G-PRO Dimple set, 13 pcs.

It might be worth it to check out the trimmed down set. I primarily used the number 10 on my Mul-T-Lock.

Just a note, I did heavy modifications to my black flags before considering the Multipicks, but at the end of the day there was nothing I could do to improve the torsional flex.

I own, enjoy, and recommend almost everything that Sparrows sells. But wow I dislike the Black Flags. I immediately wanted something else the second I started using them.

The Multipicks are really expensive, but I'd say they are worth it.
