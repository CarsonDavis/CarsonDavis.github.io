## Why This Guide?
About a year and a half ago, I got it into my head that I wanted premium leather versions of all my favorite science books. Turns out nobody sells these. So I decided to make them myself.

Since then, I have devoured literally hundreds of bookbinding tutorials. I've seen old documentary footage of how it was done 50 years ago, and I've seen modern artists pushing the boundaries of what is possible. I've read technical books on the subject, and I've talked to bookbinders in real life to get their advice.

But honestly, as much as I search, I've never been able to find that one <i>perfect guide</i> that covers everything to my satisfaction. You see, there are a lot of ways to mess up in bookbinding, and I've done most of them. You can get covers that are uneven, too long, too short, and lopsided. You can ruin your endpapers with wrinkles, and glue the pages of your book together accidentally. You can make a book that opens like a rusty prison door, or one that opens perfectly, but when you get to the inside you can see every embarrassingly uneven line of the leather imprinted into the text block.

Existing bookbinding tutorials tend to fall into a few camps
- amateurs who skip over all the important details, leaving you with a shoddy end product
- artists who wing everything but make it work through sheer talent that is impossible to replicate
- professionals who have been doing it for 50 years and forget that not everyone has a cast iron nipping press, homemade bookbinding adhesive, and a lifetime of experience

This guide is different. It will let you make a perfect book on your first try. It assumes that you are serious about this and are willing to buy or make a couple standard tools, but it does not expect you to spend hundreds of dollars on professional equipment. During every step that is possible to mess up, it will provide exact tips and instructions to avoid that mistake.

## Materials
This is a list of what I consider to be the optimal materials and tools for the home hobbyist. For example, it is trivial to buy legitimate bookbinding glue and bone folders on amazon, so I recommend buying the real thing instead of random craft glue and sticks. Meanwhile, it is not at all trivial to buy a 300lb cast iron press, so I recommend a homemade solution instead.


<b>Consumables</b>
- [headbands](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8ZNQV2J)
- [bookbinding cloth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007LS8G0)
- [98pt Davey Binders Board](https://www.talasonline.com/Davey-Binders-Board)
- [Lineco Neutral pH Adhesive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001I6FEHE)
- [paint for gilding](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NDNKQ1B)
- small paint brush, 1/2"
- 120 grit sandpaper
- silver sharpie
- paper towels
- wax paper

>**Davey Board**: I buy 9x11.5, 98pt (0.098in or 2.5mm thick) Davey board. It costs $2 per sheet, is pH neutral, and is long grain. With a thin bookbinding leather, these boards will make premium and robust covers. I'd say that you could go thinner, maybe 90 point, but I wouldn't go any thicker. Even a coffee table sized book would probably be fine with 98pt board.

- metal ruler
- 12in calipers (optional but highly recommended)
- Two #4 knitting needles (3.5mm or 9/64 diameter)

>**Blades and Brushes**: When buying Olfa blades, the black ones ([ABB-10B](https://www.amazon.com/OLFA-Replacement-Blades-Segments-ABB-10B/dp/B0042XCMSY)) are literally sharper than the silver ones. You can probably use any large brush, but I am very fond of the .75" Lineco bookbinding glue brushes.

<b>Optional Heavy Equipment</b>tb

You do not strictly need a nipping press or finishing press, but they will make your life much easier. They easy to build in a weekend for about $50 each. Alternatively, you can use two heavy boards and a couple of clamps.

>I have a [dedicated post](({% link _posts/2023-08-26-bookbinding_equipment.md %})) showing my own homemade nipping and finishing presses. If you plan on binding more than a couple books, I highly recommend building your own.
{: .prompt-info }

## Text Block
### Prep
Getting glue in the wrong places will ruin your bookbinding project. I make heavy use of wax paper and waste sheets so that I can quickly apply glue without worrying about it getting on the wrong parts of the book or my workspace.

You want waxpaper for 2 purposes
- at least 2 pieces the size of your cutting mat to go under your workspace
- at least 6 pieces slightly larger than your book to protect the pages

>The 6 book pieces need to have at least one edge square so they will sit snugly against the spine of the book. I do this by cutting a single long strip of wax paper the width of my book. Then I chop off multiple book sized sections.
{: .prompt-info }

### Preparing the Text Block

1. Start by carefully ripping off the original cover. If there is any uneven glue left over, you can sand it down or trim it carefully with a knife. 
2. We will later be gluing book cloth to the spine, and we want the best adhesion possible. To facilitate this, we will sand the spine with 80 or 120 grit sandpaper. This will roughen the surface and give the glue something to grip onto. I also like to lightly score into the glue from the original binding with a knife

>**Page Removal**: Now is the time to remove any pages you don't want in the final book. We'll be adding our own endpapers, so if there are any blank pages at the front, or pages full of advertisements or quotes that you don't want, you can carefully cut them out at this stage.
{: .prompt-info }

### Endpapers
The idea here is that we will have two single sheets of paper folded in half to make endpapers for front and back covers. One half of the sheet will ultimately glue to the cover, and the other will be the first/last page of the book. 

You will want to choose pretty paper for you endpapers, typically slightly heavier than the rest of the pages in the book. I'm personally a big fan of [TALAS's Antique Parchment End Papers](https://www.talasonline.com/Antique-Endleaf-Paper?quantity=5&color=121). They come in huge sheets that will make many, many books. TALAS also has a great selection of [decorative and marbled endpapers](https://www.talasonline.com/paper-and-board/decorative). I have bought several of the [Spanish Marbled Papers](https://www.talasonline.com/Spanish-Marbled-Papers?quantity=1&spanish=12) and have liked them all. 

You can also go completely down the rabbit hole and make your own marbled endpapers. This is almost an entire hobby on it's own, but it is a lot of fun. 

1. Determine the grain direction of your endpaper, and make certain that it will travel along the spine
2. Cut two endpapers that are slightly larger than 1x the height of your text block and 2x the width. I usually oversize them by 2mm on all sides.
3. Use your bone folder to fold them in half and make a sharp crease
4. Use a waste sheet to cover most of the endpaper, leaving only 2mm exposed at the crease. Brush glue on the exposed 2mm strip.
5. Butt your text block up against a wall or block of wood and then seat the endpaper against it. This will ensure that the endpaper is square to the text block.
6. Repeat with the second endpaper and then press the text block for 10 minutes. Don't forget to put wax paper between the text block and the press.
7. Slide a thin metal ruler between the endpaper and the text block and trim the endpaper to the size of the text block. Angle your knife away from the text block to avoid cutting into it.

>**Grain**: Grain should travel parallel to the spine. If you paper is labeled, then short/long grain means it is parallel to the short/long side of the paper. For unlabeled, cut a strip and wet one side. A strip cut along the grain will stay straight, but a strip cut across the grain will curl.
{: .prompt-info }

>**Pressing Technique**: When pressing your book, never let the press touch the book directly. Always put wax paper or Davey board between the book and the press. This will keep any slightly uneven pressure from the press from torque the pages.
{: .prompt-info }

>**Cutting Down**: You will often see this technique of over sizing and then cutting down to size after gluing. Although it is theoretically possible to measure and cut everything perfectly before gluing, life sometimes intervenes. Glue can cause slight expansion of the paper, the fold itself can rob you of 0.25mm, you might accidentally glue a hair away from the spine... But if you start too big and then cut to size at the end, the results will be perfect every time.

### Gilding the Edges
You can certainly skip this step, but it is a nice touch that can give your book a lot of pizazz. I really enjoy small artistry in matching the leather, cover design, and gilding. Traditionally, this would have been done with gold leaf, so I like to use metallic acrylics for this step. I've seen people use metallic HTV, but I've never tried it myself.

The basics of this process are to use two pieces of Davey board to sandwich the text block while sanding, then to flip the Davey board and paint the edges. All this will be done while clamped in a finishing press. 

1. Cut two pieces of Davey board larger than your text block. These will be used to sandwich the text block while painting and sanding, and can be reused for future books, so cut them generously.
2. Carefully position the text block and Davey board so the board is the same height as the edge you want to sand, and everything sticks out of your finishing press about 1/2 inch.
3. Clamp the everything together as hard as you possibly can. Loose pages will develop burrs that will ruin the painting step.
4. Sand along the length of the pages until they are smooth and even.
5. After you have sanded all 3 edges, vacuum away any dust. I typically also follow up by splaying the edges and brushing with a medium stiffness bristle brush to remove any remaining dust and burrs. If the surface of each edge is not perfectly smooth you will need to do further sanding.
6. Reclamp your text block against the painting edges of your Davey board. This time, instead of having the board flush with the edge of the text block, you will want it to be 1-2mm longer. This will allow you to paint the edge without getting paint on the text block and will ensure a stiff edge.
7. Paint two sides in one go and then flutter the pages using the unpainted side. If you've been following the tips and using only a little paint, the book should dry in 5-10 minutes and you can paint the third edge and then splay its pages by touching the now dry sides.
8. Repeat the process for a second coat. I typically stop here unless something went wrong in the painting. 
9. Use your soft bristle brush to brush the splayed edges. If your paint can't hold up to this, then it certainly can't hold up to people flipping through the book. It's fine if paint comes off, just add another layer.

>**Sacrificial Davey Board**: About a half inch of the text block must stick out of the finishing press for sanding. These exposed pages won't be very rigid, and will be very difficult to sand or paint. So we take two sacrificial pieces of Davey board to increase stiffness and let us sand and paint effectively. The board will be sanded away as we sand the text block, and the other side will be painted. It is very important to use robust board that can keep the pages pressed firmly together.
{: .prompt-info }

>**Painting Technique**: Don't use too much paint. Apply just enough to coat the edges and use long straight strokes of the brush so that the paint is even. It's more important that the surface is clean and consistent than that the first layer completely covers the paper. You can easily add more coats, but it is very annoying to fix obvious brush strokes or paint clumps.

## Making the Case
### Cutting the Covers
As with the endpapers, the covers will need to be cut so that the grain runs parallel to the spine of the book. This will ensure that the covers don't warp strangely over time. 

Cover Dimensions:
- W = same as text block
- H = text block + 6mm

Spine Dimensions:
- W = thickness of text block + 2x board thickness
- H = height of text block + 6mm

1. Measure and cut the spine and covers
2. Align the spine and covers with a 12mm gap between them
3. Use painters tape to tape the spine and covers together
4. Test fit the cover on the text block
5. Carefully seat the text block within the covers, then mark the edges of the text block on the covers
6. Add 5mm to the length of the text block and cut the covers to this length

>**Calipers**: A cheap set of 12in calipers is a game changer for bookbinding. You can measure your text block, add 6mm, then screw down the calipers to lock them at that length. Then you can use the sharp edge to stab exact points to cut into the material. Line up your ruler with the points and your cuts will be perfect every time. I use this method for cutting the endpapers, the spine, the covers, and the leather template.
{: .prompt-info }

### Cut the Leather
We will be using the covers as a template to cut the leather. This will ensure that the leather is the perfect size for the book.

1. Lay the taped cover onto a scrap piece of regular cardboard
2. Add a 20mm boarder around the cover and cut the cardboard to this size
3. Use the cardboard as a template to cut the leather
4. Take your taped together cover and use it as a template to mark out the rough location of the cover on the leather. I use silver sharpie for this.

>**Cutting the Leather**: Remember that we will eventually be cutting off the very corners of the leather. So when positioning your template, you can slide the corners slightly off the leather to get more use out of your hide. I use the 40mm Olfa rotary cutter for this step, and it is a game changer. Just position it against the edge of the cardboard and roll it along the edge. It will cut through the leather like butter.
{: .prompt-info }

### Glue the Raised Bands
Traditional bookbinding techniques used thick cords that resulted in raised bands along the spine. As techniques evolved in the early 1800s, these cords were often abandoned, but bookmakers still wanted the look of raised bands. 

False bands are created by glueing cords or leather strips to the spine. I do this with flat leather cording that is 3x1.75mm.

1. Cut 5 bands slightly longer than the width of the spine.
2. Choose the locations of your bands and mark them on the spine.
3. Lay a thin bead of glue and brush it along the marks
4. Glue the bands to the spine, and wipe away any excess
5. After the glue has dried, cut the bands at a slight angle, to form a smoother transition from the spine to the cover

>**False Bands**: You can do any spacing you want. Most 1800s books I own have even spacing. However, I like to leave 3 spaces, for Title, Author, and Date. Recently I've done two at the top (20mm and 50mm) and three at the bottom (10mm, 25mm, and 55mm). 
{: .prompt-info }

### Form the Raised Bands

1. Prepare some thin cord with a loop on one end
2. Clamp your book into the finishing press, with an inch or so of the spine sticking out
3. Glue the spine to the leather, and place it on top of the text block
4. Firmly press the leather into the spine with your bone folder. Work from the center to the ends, pressing into the corners of the bands. Sometimes you may need to use a second folder to hold the leather still while you form it into the bands.
5. If you have a pair of band nippers, now is the time to use them.
6. Roll up the leather so it won't be squished. 
7. Wrap the cord around the bands. The cord should come in at an angle and pull the leather into the crease of each band. It should be too tight to get your finger under the cord.
8. Leave everything to dry for 30 minutes
9. Remove any dried squeeze out with a micro-spatula or a knife. You want the leather to lay flat and not be glued to the edges of the spine.

>**Precision Gluing**: You don't want to get glue on the edges of the spine, just the face. I like to draw out a rectangle on the leather where the spine will go, and then lightly apply glue inside the line. Then I put glue on the spine, being careful to use plenty on the bands, and getting all the way to the edges. Finally I wipe off any excess from the edges before placing it on the leather.
{: .prompt-info }

## Interlude: Finalize Text Block
It's finally time to add the headbands, spine cloth, book ribbon to the text block.

1. Cut your headbands slightly wider than th text block
2. Cut your spine cloth to fit in between the headbands and to extend at least 1 inch to either side of the text block.
3. If you are doing a book ribbon, cut it way longer than needed and glue it to the spine. You can trim it later when the book is done.
4. Mark the centerline of the spine cloth, and glue it and the headbands to the text block. Be sure to fully saturate the headbands and cloth with glue, and to press them down firmly.

## Finishing the Case
### Glue the Leather
- use waxpaper to let you brush glue all the way to the edges of the covers
- the leather may have stretched/moved, so re align the covers with the spine and draw the final positions using your spacers
- glue inside the lines you drew for the covers
- put wax paper between the book and the covers and press this for 10 minutes just to it is nicely seated

### Cut the Leather
- use the 15mm egde trimmer to cut the leather all around the covers
- use the corner template to trim the corners 1.5x the board thickness from the corner

### Folding the Leather
- need to use waxpaper as you brush the glue on the leather. lets you get all the way to the edges. then you throw away the waxpaper
- start with the top and bottom of the book, the long sides. fold them tightly and be sure to get glue into the creases
- do not glue inside the hinge gap, we will do that last
- trick with the micro spatula, where you fold the teeny tiny corner of the leather in before folding the edges of the book
- once the corners are folded, you cut a 45 degree line from the corner and use tweezers to remove the excess leather
- trim the corner if needed and add glue and fold it tightly

### Form the Hinge Gap
- do one side of the book at a time
- put glue along the crease between the leather and the Davey board on either side of the hinge gap
- use the bone folder to press the leather into the gap and form it
- use your knitting needle to press the leather onto the sides of the davey board all along the gap and hold it while you do the other side

info: this step is the most delicate of the entire operation. if you want to take it easy, you can press the book at this point to fully seat the hinges. however, you are on the home stretch, so i often power through and quickly glue the endpapers in.


## Casing In
### Glue the Text Block
- place the book inside the cover, and carefully align the text block with the covers. you want even spacing everywhere, and when closed the text block should be pressed as far as possible towards the spine
- being absolutely sure to maintain the hinge gap, open the top cover and brush glue onto the endpaper. you need to start at the spine and work outwards. there should be wax paper between the text block and the endpapers. you need two pieces: one to use during gluing, and a second to protect the text block while pressing
- close the cover, and don't fuck with it

### Press the Book
- write some stuff about the knitting needles and adding the metal plates

## Casing In

when cutting the leather, extend 1.5x the board thickness from the corner
you can make the diagonal cut and then pull out the leather

## Endpapers, Gluing the Spine, Trimming the Edges

The endpapers should be the same size as the text block. You can always cut them oversized and then trim them once they are glued on. 

Q: will I have the endpapers be inside of the original cover?
Q: how big do i make the gap, and how to i calculate it?

- cut a slightly oversized endpaper and fold it in half
- use a piece of parmament paper to protect the text block and glue a 1cm strip of the endpaper to the text block
- if you endpapers are not two sided, you might need to back them with another piece of paper before gluing them to the text block




Gluing shit

Had problems with accidently gluing the sides before i wanted to
had problems holding everything securely

watch from this time stamp. he makes it really easy.
watch the whole video, it is very good.
ffs he makes doing the paper so easy. the fold technique is perfect.

## Avoiding Warped Boards

[Avoiding Warped Boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWw6A7SObCo)

The side exposed to moisture will expand, and form the top of the curve.

Paper expands across the grain

- the thinner material should receive the adhesive, and the thinner material should be nearer the text block
   - if you put dry paper on a wet board, the thin paper will expand and wrinkle
   - when boards do warp, they should warp in towards the text block, not away from it. therefore the thin, pulling material should be closest to the text block
- PVA is a drier adhesive than paste, so it is less likely to warp the board
- DAS bookbinding doesn't criss cross the grain except when making springbacks

book cloth will stretch more in the grain direction.

## How to find grain direction
Long Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the long side of the paper.
Short Grain: The direction of the grain is parallel to the short side of the paper.

Grain should be head to tail, meaning parallel to the spine.

Bend it both ways. The way it bends easiest forms the axis that traces the grain direction.
Wet it on one side. A strip cut along the grain will stay straight, but a strip cut across the grain will curl.
You can cut a small slip of paper and wet it.

## Endpapers
[An Introduction to Endpapers for Bookbinding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUSkUiooDnQ)
- Not as practically informative as some other videos, but an interesting overview of the history and purpose of endpapers.

[Made Endpapers](https://youtu.be/4vN5xSY86iw?si=EI4Vi1TQfCsqTVQ8)
When using a single sided endpaper, you can back it with another piece of paper. You often do this by having two folded sheets (4 leafs) with the interior two glued together (3 final leafs). This can be done by fully gluing the interior pages, created a 'made page', or by gluing only the edge, created a 'flexible made page'

## Making a Cover in Affinity Design
I use a custom "Book Cover" preset in Affinity Design 2. 
Width: 350mm
Height: 300mm
DPI: 144
Document Units: mm

Measure the book cover, not the spine. Under measure if you need to.


144x218
24x218

make cover shapes that match these dimensions.

copy one of your covers and then use the contour tool to make the border. i've been doing it inset by 7.5mm. You will want to give it transparent fill but a colored stroke. I've been using 2.5-3 pt for the stroke width.


Hold alt and drag to copy the cover.

For some of my recent books, I have been making simplified vector versions of the original covers. Find a nice copy of the original cover online and paste it into your document at 50+ transparency. Then trace over it with the pen tool. You can use the contour tool to make the border.


Tips for using the pen tool

A to select and edit nodes
V to select shapes
P to select the pen tool
While using the pen tool, if an existing node is highlighted blue, you can continue from it. 
You can edit your curves by clicking a node and then moving the handles. You can also hover over a curve and see a wavy line and drag it to adjust the curve. You can add new nodes along the path of curves.



When making the bands, create a single band of the correct dimensions, slightly darker than the cover material. The position it at the very top of the spine and copy paste it for each band. Measure on the book from the top of the spine to the top of each band and use math in the tranform panel to add the numbers to each band.

Once you make the band text, you can align vertically and distribute horizontally. You always want to select the bands first, and then the text.
 
I like to group everything into Book Components and Print Components, then hide the print components and export as PDF.

When bringing it into silhoutte, import it as vector but do <i>not</i> group. This will allow you to change the cut settings for the text vs the cover.

Arrange it in silhoutte and position it reasonably close to the top. I try to leave some space around the covers, because any excess plastic can be marked and used as a positioning aide. Try to leave at least 10 mm on all sides, since the inset is usually around 7.5mm.


Once it is placed, go to object, mirror, then flip horizontally. 

Don't cut off more than you need, just 20mm or so beyond the expected bottom. You are leaving some room for positioning and some room for the cutter to be misaligned.

The shiny side goes down
