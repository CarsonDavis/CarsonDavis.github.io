# Fossil Writeups

Pamphlet-style writeups for notable hominin fossils.

## Structure

Each fossil gets two files:
- `{fossil_name}.md` - Final writeup (word-count constrained)
- `{fossil_name}_background.md` - Research notes and citations

## Format

Final writeups have four sections:
1. **Discovery** - When, where, who, interesting drama
2. **Why [Fossil] Matters** - What makes this specimen significant
3. **[Species] Context** - Broader species-level information
4. **Open Questions** - Current debates and unknowns

## Word Counts

Target: 3 pamphlet pages per fossil.

| Section | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Discovery + Why It Matters | ~1 page |
| Species Context | ~1 page |
| Open Questions | ~1 page |

Current baseline from Shanidar 1:
- Sections 1-2: ~120 words (fits 1 page)
- Sections 3-4: needs trimming

## Workflow

1. Gather research in `_background.md`
2. Distill into final writeup
3. Check word counts against targets
