## Discovery
In 1957, excavators led by Ralph Solecki uncovered a remarkably complete Neanderthal skeleton in Shanidar Cave, high in the Zagros Mountains of northern Iraq. 

## Why Shanidar 1 Matters
Estimated to be 40–50 years old at death, Shanidar 1 lived with several injuries throughout his life. He had a crushed left eye socket that likely left him partially blind, a missing right forearm and hand, major arthritis in the legs that would have caused a painful limp, and bony growths in the ear canals consistent with serious hearing loss. His long survival is considered evidence of caregiving in Neanderthals.

## Neanderthal Context

To date, researchers have identified hundreds of Neanderthal individuals across Europe and Asia, and have sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from dozens. Genetic evidence suggests their lineage and ours split well over 400,000 years ago, yet later contact is clear: many living people outside Africa carry about 1–2% Neanderthal ancestry from interbreeding.

Isotope studies often place Neanderthals high on the food chain, consistent with heavy meat use. Their front teeth also show distinctive wear consistent with using the mouth as a “third hand,” often linked to hide or material working. They maintained sophisticated stone toolkits, made composite tools with adhesives, and repeatedly used fire—technology that shaped what they could eat, where they could live, and how they socialized.

## Open Questions
It was once thought Neanderthals lacked symbolism or ritual, but the evidence is no longer so easy to dismiss: pigments, occasional engravings, and a debated but growing set of cases consistent with deliberate burial.

The open question is how common these behaviors were. Shanidar 1 hints at deep social support, but we still don’t know how widespread caregiving was, or what daily help looked like across different Neanderthal groups.
